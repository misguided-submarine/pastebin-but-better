4:34 PM - TAW | Pizza: why'd you ban fancy from the discord server lol
4:33 PM - TAW | Schizo: cuz i felt like it
4:33 PM - TAW | Schizo: and hes a bitch
4:34 PM - TAW | Pizza: explain lol
4:34 PM - TAW | Pizza: is it about the morphling thing
4:33 PM - TAW | Schizo: yes
4:34 PM - TAW | Pizza: what about it
4:33 PM - TAW | Schizo: when u say im not dealing with schizos morph when u cna play 4 hereos well than u obv have nothing to say worth hearing
4:35 PM - TAW | Pizza: hold on that's a lot to unpack lol
4:35 PM - TAW | Pizza: so it bothered you that he said he doesn't wanna deal with you on morph
4:34 PM - TAW | Schizo: its rly not
4:35 PM - TAW | Pizza: and it bothers you because he apparently has a four hero pool
4:35 PM - TAW | Pizza: it also bothers you because you wanted morph but he picked it
4:35 PM - TAW | Schizo: it bothered me that he takes morph when i clearly state b4 the game even begins that i want morph
4:36 PM - TAW | Pizza: so when you do that to redman on pangolier, it's fine?
4:36 PM - TAW | Pizza: or when you insist on banning tinker just to prevent fancy from having it, that's fine?
4:35 PM - TAW | Schizo: yes, its fine because i was proving a point to redman
4:35 PM - TAW | Schizo: about shards
4:35 PM - TAW | Schizo: and pangolier ult
4:35 PM - TAW | Schizo: i wasnt doing it just to be a dick
4:37 PM - TAW | Pizza: Well fancy was also picking morph bc he wanted to play the hero lol
4:37 PM - TAW | Pizza: especially considering that he first picked it like three times in the past two days in pubs
4:36 PM - TAW | Schizo: well i clearly stated b4 we even started that i was picking it
4:36 PM - TAW | Schizo: it doesnt change anything
4:37 PM - TAW | Pizza: yes it does lol
4:38 PM - TAW | Pizza: it's okay for you to do it to redman because 'you have your own reasons and they're okay'
4:38 PM - TAW | Pizza: but when he does it to you, it's an issue
4:38 PM - TAW | Pizza: even if he has his own reasons
4:37 PM - TAW | Schizo: social situations r confusing rnt they, when some1 says they r picking a hero its not cool 2 just pick it
4:37 PM - TAW | Schizo: without sayin shit
4:38 PM - TAW | Pizza: well to be fair, he did say why
4:38 PM - TAW | Schizo: ya he said im not dealing with shcizo morph
4:39 PM - TAW | Pizza: I dunno schizo the way i see it, you want to just meme and make jokes and make fun of people and just have a good time at other people's expense, and that's fine and all, but don't expect people to take you seriously, or expect you to have feelings and a soft spot when all you do is meme at people
4:39 PM - TAW | Pizza: like you'll snipe other people's heroes bc fuck them, you'll show up to a TI inhouse and ban wisp and meepo and let hte last pick random, but then expect to be taken seriously when you want to be taken seriously
4:40 PM - TAW | Pizza: Like, you're still my friend, and I'd like to keep it that way
4:39 PM - TAW | Schizo: i dont know wut ur talking about i like to play and have fun like a normal person, what u call memming i call enjoying the game, i was just wanting to learn morph nmroe uz i had been picking him recently.
4:39 PM - TAW | Schizo: if we r being honest
4:39 PM - TAW | Schizo: u should take a closer look at urself
4:39 PM - TAW | Schizo: instead of me
4:40 PM - TAW | Pizza: Explaiun
4:40 PM - TAW | Pizza: *explain
4:39 PM - TAW | Schizo: and see where other people rly see the problem
4:39 PM - TAW | Schizo: if u cnat see it it isnt worth explainging
4:41 PM - TAW | Pizza: Lol okay what a high horse you're on. "You should look at yourself and see your own issues. But oh btw if you can't see them then it's not worth talking about"
4:41 PM - TAW | Pizza: Way to present a point and start a discussion
4:40 PM - TAW | Schizo: ya because if u cant look at urself and hohw u communicate objectively than it isnt worht me telling u how
4:41 PM - TAW | Pizza: I'm open to criticism, I've made that clear
4:41 PM - TAW | Schizo: because it wont change anything
4:41 PM - TAW | Schizo: i can see how my actions may be memey as u say but i can also see how over the entire time i have played the game i have ahad many close friends that enjoy playing with me and u r the only one who has problems with my "meming"
4:44 PM - TAW | Pizza: Once again, I'm not saying that playing in a memey way is an issue. I'm saying that you shouldn't try to fuck with people, taking their heroes, banning them intentionally, showing up to aTI inhouse and just fucking around, and then be a bitch when someone does something even remotely similar to you
4:44 PM - TAW | Pizza: Being memey is fine, I do it with fancy all the time
4:44 PM - TAW | Pizza: sometimes i'll just random, or take his runes, or pick fucking techies
4:44 PM - TAW | Schizo: as i explained the pangolier was to show how ult and shards works, i dont ban anyone intentionally ever so idk wut that is, and i was trying to see in the inhouse how much banning effects the gameplay in a low level match as compared to a pro game
4:45 PM - TAW | Pizza: That'
4:46 PM - TAW | Pizza: That's something that could so easily be demonstrated in a private lobby in two minutes
4:46 PM - TAW | Pizza: instead of just sniping someone's hero pick and ruining a pub for 40 minutes lol
4:45 PM - TAW | Schizo: well it is a ti inhouse coorect to learn? i dont think i ruined the game
4:46 PM - TAW | Pizza: Okay but the TI inhouse thing is still once again, selfish
4:45 PM - TAW | Schizo: i think the game was ruinedby a defeatest attitude
4:46 PM - TAW | Pizza: you messed up the game for the four people on your team for your own sake
4:46 PM - TAW | Pizza: so that you could supposedly  'study how shit bans have an affect in inhousese of varying skill brackets'
4:45 PM - TAW | Schizo: we did fine gfor most of the gmae even with a negative attitude
4:47 PM - TAW | Pizza: Uhhhh we had no win condition
4:47 PM - TAW | Pizza: unless they threw
4:47 PM - TAW | Pizza: the whole poitn is to try, and then analyze the game
4:47 PM - TAW | Pizza: that was pretty clear
4:46 PM - TAW | Schizo: if we r talking about "ruining games" and making them not fun gthen u should worry more about how u comunicate with ur team
4:47 PM - TAW | Pizza: Explain
4:46 PM - TAW | Schizo: because many people find it to be aggrevating and have a negative impact on how they view the game
4:46 PM - TAW | Schizo: "game"
4:46 PM - TAW | Schizo: because it is meant for fun
4:46 PM - TAW | Schizo: but u cause people to not enjoy it
4:48 PM - TAW | Pizza: That's so naive lol. If a team's getting shit on, saying that we probably lost isn't gonna make getting shit on less fun. You're still getting shat on
4:48 PM - TAW | Pizza: Also, saying videogames and esports are for fun is as naive as saying that anything else even remotely recreational is just for fun
4:47 PM - TAW | Schizo: it changes how the team views the game
4:49 PM - TAW | Pizza: Yeah, isn't that the point?
4:48 PM - TAW | Schizo: taw is about having a fun comunninty for people to paly
4:48 PM - TAW | Schizo: its not about esports
4:49 PM - TAW | Pizza: If our team is losing, and we have no idea why we lost, it's helpful to understand why
4:48 PM - TAW | Schizo: we rnt pros
4:49 PM - TAW | Schizo: ya but its also helpful in games to not be like oh u shouldnt have done that when its already over,its better to say ok heres wut we should do
4:50 PM - TAW | Pizza: Yes, and I'm part of TAW not only to enjoy myself and have a community of people to play dota with, but also teach people
4:50 PM - TAW | Pizza: it's why I'm a training inhouse, it's why i was selected to be one
4:50 PM - TAW | Pizza: I'm not here to just sugarcoat stuff for people
4:49 PM - TAW | Schizo: ya but obv people may not like how u do it
4:51 PM - TAW | Pizza: If someone's struggling and they want to get better, of course I'm gonna say something. If someone doesn't care about that at all, then you know what? It's my mistake for saying anything to those people
4:51 PM - TAW | Pizza: I can concede that
4:50 PM - TAW | Schizo: tahts fine
4:51 PM - TAW | Pizza: Either way, I dislike playing with those kinds of players anyways
4:52 PM - TAW | Pizza: I can't empathize with peopel who complain about losses and hwo bullshit the game is, but take no action to get better at the game
4:52 PM - TAW | Pizza: So it's my mistake for playing with those people in teh first place
4:52 PM - TAW | Pizza: I also take issue with people (like redman or rebel) who constantly complain about teammates but will hardly be better than any of them, if at all
4:52 PM - TAW | Pizza: but that's unrelated
4:51 PM - TAW | Schizo: all im saying  is u shouldnt expect everyone 2 be in ur position when it comes 2 the game
4:53 PM - TAW | Pizza: Well I don't. Maybe I need to be better about that with some people, but I don't coach lach or mike or half the people in TAW anyways
4:53 PM - TAW | Pizza: they're 2k and don't care to get better, or think they're already good enough
4:53 PM - TAW | Pizza: I don't bother with them
4:53 PM - TAW | Pizza: not unless they ask
4:53 PM - TAW | Pizza: explicitly
4:53 PM - TAW | Pizza: i.e. What should I get next? AC or Shivas
4:54 PM - TAW | Pizza: All I was saying, regarding the earlier topic, was that you shoudn't be bothered by fancy sniping your morph bc he wants to play it, when you think it's fine to pick pangolier when redman explicitly said he wanted it for teh past two games, even if you had some reason to pick it
4:54 PM - TAW | Schizo: well if fancy wants to play morph then he should say somehtin like a normal person and say something like hey u mind if i play morph instead cuz i been playing him recently, instead of being smug saying im not dealing with schizo morph
4:56 PM - TAW | Pizza: well I won't deny that that's perhaps dickish
4:55 PM - TAW | Schizo: im a p reasonable easy goign person its y for as long as i have palyed dota people want to aply with me so i would obv say sure no prob
4:56 PM - TAW | Pizza: I woudln't say that to redman if i sniped his timbersaw pick because i'm sure as fuck not dealing with his timber
4:56 PM - TAW | Pizza: so like
4:56 PM - TAW | Pizza: i can agree that it was dickish
4:55 PM - TAW | Schizo: well if u odnt wanna deal with someone palying something in the video game then dont play with them at alll
4:57 PM - TAW | Pizza: well it's still a mutual exchange when inviting them to a party
4:57 PM - TAW | Pizza: i invite people liek ant or redman or rebel bc i'd rather have them than most randies
4:57 PM - TAW | Pizza: and they don't have to accept. if they do, then they'd rather play in our party than do whatever it is we're doing
4:57 PM - TAW | Pizza: so regardless it's still an exchange
4:57 PM - TAW | Schizo: ya but they dont expect 2 be treated liek tehy r lesser than others
4:57 PM - TAW | Schizo: they r people playing to play, playing 2 win, playing 2 have fun
4:57 PM - TAW | Schizo: it ruins the point for them if they have  anegative experience
4:58 PM - TAW | Pizza: Yeah and if they want to play to win, they shouldn't be bothered when I suggest to not go hood on antimgae
4:58 PM - TAW | Schizo: i wrtoe all those things for a reason
4:59 PM - TAW | Pizza: Also, they konw the pretenses
4:58 PM - TAW | Schizo: winning isnt everything
4:59 PM - TAW | Pizza: When redman or dally or sfor join, they know that they're joining fancy and me or you and they know that they're worse at the game
4:59 PM - TAW | Pizza: and yeah, winning isn't everything
4:59 PM - TAW | Pizza: I can have a great fucking time in a loss
4:59 PM - TAW | Pizza: or be satisfied in a loss
4:59 PM - TAW | Pizza: or be disappointed in a win
4:59 PM - TAW | Schizo: like u said earlier joining a party is to get away from the worst possible outcome of dealing with extreme cases in pubs
5:00 PM - TAW | Pizza: No, it's to get away from the average.
4:59 PM - TAW | Schizo: it doesnt mean they rnt looking for soemthing specific in a party
5:00 PM - TAW | Pizza: I'd rather play with randies than lach most of the time
5:00 PM - TAW | Pizza: it's to avoid the average
5:00 PM - TAW | Pizza: not the worst
5:00 PM - TAW | Schizo: again tahts u, be objective, most people paly in party to not deal with extreme toxicity of pubs
5:01 PM - TAW | Pizza: and to have a higher chance of winning
5:01 PM - TAW | Pizza: because you have a higher chance when everyone's in teamspeak and discord working together
5:01 PM - TAW | Pizza: and on the same page
5:01 PM - TAW | Pizza: it's a balance of all those things
5:01 PM - TAW | Schizo: i think its mostly to enjoy the game more
5:01 PM - TAW | Schizo: overall
5:02 PM - TAW | Pizza: either way, what's your point? yeah some people weigh different things differently. Some poeple care more about fun than winning, others they're dependent on each other
5:02 PM - TAW | Pizza: But absolutely no one can deny that you're more likely to have fun when winning than when losing
5:01 PM - TAW | Schizo: most care most about enjoying the game
5:02 PM - TAW | Pizza: if you think that, you're just delusional
5:01 PM - TAW | Schizo: ofc id rather win tahn lose
5:03 PM - TAW | Pizza: as would literally anyone else
5:03 PM - TAW | Pizza: and yeah maybe you weigh having fun and enjoying yourself higher than winning
5:03 PM - TAW | Pizza: for me it' sless
5:02 PM - TAW | Schizo: but id rather lose in a party and have fun than win not having fun
5:03 PM - TAW | Pizza: for fancy it's even less
5:03 PM - TAW | Schizo: all im saying and this is the last thing ill say, is that if u ry want to help people get better, treat them more like people and less liek their mistakes
5:04 PM - TAW | Pizza: Fair enough.
5:03 PM - TAW | Schizo: lkeep in mind im not the one who necessarily has these problems, others have come 2 me
5:05 PM - TAW | Pizza: Last thign I'll say is, you can't have it both ways. You can't meme on people but then expect to be taken seriously whenever you see fit. It's not a toggle, it's part of building a relationship with anyone. It's hard to ever take you seriously when, even in a situation or brief discussion with serious pretenses, you'll just meme or be like "well maybe you're just bad." 90% of the time.
5:06 PM - TAW | Schizo: i only say that stuff to lighten the mood. but i understand wut ur sayin
