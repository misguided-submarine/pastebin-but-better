Bump Mines in Competitive CS:GO

[2:07 AM] pizza: hmmmmm
[2:07 AM] fancy: hmmm
[2:08 AM] fancy: game has
[2:08 AM] fancy: not improved
[2:08 AM] fancy: I see
[2:08 AM] pizza: THEY ADDED
[2:08 AM] pizza: FUCKING
[2:08 AM] pizza: JUMPPADS
[2:08 AM] pizza: TO COMPETITIVE
[2:08 AM] pizza: NOT JUST CASUAL FOR TESTING
[2:08 AM] fancy: so like
[2:08 AM] fancy: can we just play
[2:08 AM] fancy: quake
[2:08 AM] fancy: for real tho
[2:08 AM] pizza: this is
[2:08 AM] pizza: so bad
[2:08 AM] pizza: next they're gonna add 9 classes
[2:09 AM] pizza: like i almost get why they wanted to change something
[2:09 AM] pizza: timings are so established
[2:10 AM] pizza: and movement is so stale in csgo
[2:10 AM] pizza: but like
[2:10 AM] fancy: which is a shame
[2:10 AM] fancy: because
[2:10 AM] pizza: this is kinda
[2:10 AM] fancy: source engine
[2:10 AM] fancy: is so legit
[2:10 AM] fancy: for movement
[2:10 AM] pizza: this is shotgun to kill fly solution
[2:10 AM] fancy: but like it's so opposite
[2:10 AM] fancy: to everything csgo is about
[2:10 AM] fancy: which is
[2:10 AM] fancy: precision
[2:10 AM] fancy: and deliberate decisions
[2:10 AM] fancy: there's like no fluidity in that game at all
[2:11 AM] pizza: yeah it's not like
[2:11 AM] pizza: you can shoot while midair
[2:11 AM] pizza: or even for a full second after landing from midair
[2:11 AM] pizza: cough cough deagle
[2:13 AM] pizza: I do like the concept of disrupting the whole movement and angle timing
[2:13 AM] pizza: but this is some big sus
[2:13 AM] fancy: I mean
[2:13 AM] fancy: yeah
[2:13 AM] fancy: if csgo wasn't
[2:13 AM] fancy: how it is
[2:13 AM] fancy: but like
[2:13 AM] fancy: you'd have to reinvent
[2:13 AM] fancy: the entire game
[2:13 AM] fancy: at this piont
[2:13 AM] fancy: cus like
[2:13 AM] fancy: every gunplay mechanic
[2:13 AM] fancy: is thrown out the window
[2:13 AM] fancy: if you make the game about movement
[2:13 AM] fancy: like if u see quake
[2:13 AM] fancy: EVERY GUN
[2:13 AM] fancy: IS FUCKIGN BORING
[2:13 AM] pizza: i feel like there was a way to address this issue
[2:13 AM] fancy: IT JUST SHOOTS IN A STRAIGHT LINE
[2:13 AM] pizza: without just adding fucking jumppads
[2:13 AM] fancy: you let people bunnyhop
[2:14 AM] fancy: and then everyone learns how to bunnyhop
[2:14 AM] fancy: and then
[2:14 AM] fancy: timings are just
[2:14 AM] fancy: 30% faster
[2:14 AM] fancy: XD
[2:14 AM] pizza: no
[2:14 AM] fancy: I don't know if there's a way to change much abvout csog honestly
[2:14 AM] fancy: it's a pretty solved game
[2:14 AM] fancy: and that's cus like
[2:14 AM] fancy: it's so straightforward
[2:14 AM] fancy: it's not like quake
[2:14 AM] pizza: i still stand by my statement where csgo is prob the perfect example of an esport atm
[2:14 AM] fancy: I mean yeah
[2:14 AM] pizza: anyone can watch it and know what's goign on immediately
[2:14 AM] fancy: it's the best esport of all time
[2:14 AM] fancy: I think
[2:14 AM] fancy: but like
[2:15 AM] pizza: cs in general yeah
[2:15 AM] fancy: part of that
[2:15 AM] fancy: is due to simplicity
[2:15 AM] fancy: which means that
[2:15 AM] fancy: it will get stale
[2:15 AM] fancy: and I don't know if you can fix that
