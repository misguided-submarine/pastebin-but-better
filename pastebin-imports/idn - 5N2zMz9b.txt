This started out as a short message and now it’s an essay. Idk
I just don’t know how to feel, or what I should do. I’m not even sure if writing this is going to be cathartic or not. Every time I think to write something down, I wonder if I’m overreacting or being irrational or just getting heated in the moment. Sometimes I sleep thinking about this stuff and wake up feeling hopeful. And then shit happens again, and suddenly everything is gloomy again. Here’s a rant and some other shit I dunno. 
You know what bothers me? All the shit you went back on in a heartbeat. You would say that Blairin's a garbage person and talk about how you can't stand him. You would say that Tyler's a retard who thinks he's better than you at Dota because he was boosted up by his stack. Casta got his account fucking boosted to Divine 5 or some shit. And yet you play with them because Nikki wants you to. Yoshi and I both joke about how you'll basically do anything she asks you to do. "I never play custom games in Dota and they dum." And it stayed that way, no matter how many times we’d insist that a certain one is fun and worth at least trying for 20 minutes. But Nikki wants to play autochess and you play autochess. It just feels like you've been super inconsistent as of late, and I wouldn't be surprised if you started drinking simply because nikki said it's fun or some shit. Or if she told you that Spongebob is a good show and that you should watch it, you’d go watch it. 

I get it. People change. Part of tolerating them is that you’ve become better at handling their shit. But it really just rubs me the wrong way I guess. I wouldn’t be surprised if I were to look back at this letter years from now and think that I was just retarded. 

Do you remember when I was in India and some conversation came up about being replaced? I stayed up thinking about that for a long time. I don’t know how else to explain it, but here goes? I feel like I’m no longer my best friend’s best friend. I feel like it’s a one-way street with you, that my gestures and efforts are all futile, and hardly ever reciprocated. When this semester started, I’ve been doing what I can to get as much of my homework done as early as possible so I can get home and hopefully play with you + others. And then I get home and it’s MHW or something. And you know what? That’s fine. I’d be stupid if I didn’t acknowledge all the times I was balls deep in BO4 or TF2 when you wanted to play Dota or drawing game or something. But you know what hurts? When I’m get home, finish my homework, get on discord to play dota, see that no one’s online, and go afk for 15 minutes, only to come back and see that you’re already in like a 3 stack and in a game. It’d be like if you sent messages about how you were waiting for the squad to come home so we can play versus for the 698541560th time, only to see that 20 minutes later, we started a match already without you. It would feel personal, no? It’s not like I don’t reach out. I regularly tell you when I’m home, or when I’m free, and I ask you quite frequently (especially recently) if/when you want to play something. It’s also not like I wouldn’t get off BO4 or TF2 in a heartbeat if you actually ever asked me if I wanted to play something. Hell, I got off BO4 with Truman and Badger when you said you wanted to draw, even though I didn’t really feel like it, and even though I fucking can’t stand Tyler’s presence. But I don’t feel like I ever get the same sort of vibe from you (unless I’m basically the last resort and all your primaries are occupied.) Even when I was in India and regularly sending snaps or messages, you only actually reached out asking when I would return after Nikki and Julian and everyone else was dead. I was excited at first, and then I realized that the only reason you even landed on my name on the list of people to reach out to was because no one else was around to entertain you. It’s a shitty feeling. I know I wouldn’t do the same if the situation was reversed. Hell, even when your grandparents are visiting and you can’t touch your computer, I still reach out every day and hope that you can join us sooner rather than later. Being missed is a nice feeling I guess, and I don’t really ever get that. Not from you at least. I don’t really care to do the Easter eggs. I don’t really care to do Gorod. But I wanted to find some excuse for us to maybe do something together. Ditto for Minecraft, really. And that would have been enough for me. 

Maybe I expect too much. Maybe I just have unrealistic expectations from my best friend. Maybe I’m clingy or some shit. But you know what? You’re honestly all I have as far as close friends are concerned. Sure, I talk to people at school about shallow trivial shit, and I play BO4 with some dummies once in a while. But you’re the only person I really open up to about anything, the person I still care about the most. You’re still the only person I’ve told my school fuckup story to. And part of that comes from the fact that I look up to you. You are smarter than me, more logical than me, and you have better qualities than I do. I admire your transparency and your consistency, and I’ve been taking efforts the past few years to embody those qualities more. So yeah, it does hurt to get pushed to the side, or to not be given the same respect as you give to people who don’t really care either way. Sometimes it’s big things, sometimes it’s small things. Simple things. This is gonna sound petty, but it is something I’ve noticed for a while. Anytime Julian or Yoshi or Nikki or anyone else we play with does something above-average, you usually give some superlative about how they’re a god or they’re incredible or something. But for what seems to be years now, you don’t really ever do that with me. Ever. You can watch VOD’s to validate this, I’m sure. My complaint isn’t with the compliment. Is it that I need you to call me a God to feel good or something? No. But it does feel kinda bad when I don’t ever get a kudos when anyone else we play with does. It feels deliberate. I know, it seems petty, but it’s a small thing I’ve picked up on that does make me feel like I’m being excluded from something, and I don’t quite know why. 

After writing all this, I have no clue whether I’m being rational or not. I thought writing some of this would help me organize my thoughts, but I’m honestly more confused than I was an hour ago. I think, more than anything, I just don’t want to be part of a one-way street friendship anymore. If I’m just like any other friend to you, and you don’t really care whether or not you spend time with me or not, I’d rather just know that and try to move on or something. I don’t want to hang around discord and try to spend time with people who don’t really care to spend time with me, who wouldn’t really care if I just got up and vanished for a year. Because it’s not mutual. Idk what I would do if you left, and you definitely gave me a scare with all the Hope stuff way back when. But like, whenever you’d complain that I or other people weren’t around to do shit, I would always take a conscious effort to be there more frequently and communicate. I’d send more discord messages, say when I’m home, ask you when you’re home, and be here to play if you wanted to. But most of the time, it felt like that wasn’t ever appreciated or even acknowledged. 

If you don’t really want to spend time with me in the same way that I want to with you, if you don’t really care about me anymore, I think I could bear with that. It would take time and effort, but I could learn to readjust. If you got up one day and said you never wanted to talk to me again, or that you wouldn’t really care for more than 10 minutes if I disappeared or died or something, I think I could understand. We’ve been friends for nearly 7 years now. People change, get tired of each other, and move on. I don’t even know that I’d blame you. Obviously, a significant part of me believes that none of that’s true. But every night, I start to get more doubtful and wonder if I’m just deluding myself. All I want I guess is to just know where I stand in all of this, because I don’t want to keep believing in something that isn’t there. I’ll always still love you and care about you, and I’ll never forget all the ways you’ve made my life better these past few years. If you feel like you need a break, that’s fine. But if enough is enough, I’d at least like to know. 

During all those times you’d go on about how we’ll all just move on and graduate college and get jobs and forget about you, I would feel bad and vow to never do that. These days, I wonder if now it’s just something you wish would happen. 



9:37 AM] fancy: do you remember when I said that I'm a bad person to date
[9:37 AM] fancy: part of that has to do with how
[9:38 AM] fancy: I more or less refuse to do things if I don't want to do them
[9:38 AM] fancy: I've never really been big on the whole "I will do ur shit with u if u do my shit with me" thing
[9:38 AM] fancy: this is part of why I was so aggressive about Jeff to Bani
[9:39 AM] fancy: because he had that same attitude, where he doesn't really care necessarily if they did any specific things together
[9:39 AM] fancy: he didn't expect her to do things he liked if she didn't
[9:39 AM] fancy: and he didn't feel he should be expected to do things she liked that he didn't
[9:39 AM] fancy: I'm the same way
[9:40 AM] fancy: I don't expect you to ever do stuff with me just as an excuse to do stuff with me
[9:40 AM] fancy: I don't expect it, and I don't even think it's like... that admirable in general, I guess?
[9:40 AM] fancy: to me, it just seems insane
[9:41 AM] fancy: maybe some people can look past the fakeness of pretending to enjoy something for the sake of someone else
[9:41 AM] fancy: but I can't
[9:42 AM] fancy: I don't want to do things with people that aren't enjoying the activity
[9:42 AM] fancy: it just makes things awkward and less fun
[9:43 AM] fancy: you ask sometimes if I want to play something
[9:43 AM] fancy: but it's rarely ever something specific
[9:43 AM] fancy: and it very much comes off of
[9:43 AM] fancy: "I'm not really interested in playing whatever game you're going to suggest but i feel obligated to ask for your sake so here I am"
[9:43 AM] fancy: and that just doesn't interest me
[9:44 AM] fancy: to use dota as an example
[9:45 AM] fancy: there's such an overwhelming pile on the side of you just bitching about the game, or saying it's bad or not fun, or loading in and being like, "I don't want to play any of these heroes", or any other number of negative things
[9:45 AM] fancy: that it's like
[9:45 AM] fancy: from my perspective
[9:46 AM] fancy: it would be insane to keep inviting you or accepting the offers/requests you (seemingly) make out of sense of obligation
[9:46 AM] fancy: and maybe you actually do want to play recently, idk
[9:47 AM] fancy: but like I had to try (and fail) to explain to tyler the other day, the world doesn't exist in a vacuum that resets every day
[9:47 AM] fancy: context exists
[9:49 AM] fancy: do I wish you enjoyed more of the things I did
[9:49 AM] fancy: like actively enjoyed?
[9:49 AM] fancy: of course
[9:49 AM] fancy: I like playing things with you
[9:49 AM] fancy: when you guys aren't just being mean to me, that is
[9:49 AM] fancy: but like
[9:49 AM] fancy: if you don't
[9:50 AM] fancy: I'm not gonna sit around all melancholy and complain
[9:50 AM] fancy: and keep bringing it up
[9:50 AM] fancy: I used to do that
[9:50 AM] fancy: it didn't help anything
[9:50 AM] fancy: lol
[9:51 AM] fancy: your thing about how I used to talk about how everyone is going to move on
[9:51 AM] fancy: trying to avoid that is like trying to avoid death
[9:51 AM] fancy: stop worrying about it
[9:51 AM] fancy: yeah, wanna be sad about it when you reflect on that fact sometime? sure
[9:51 AM] fancy: I am
[9:51 AM] fancy: but like
[9:52 AM] fancy: you aren't going to be able tos top it
[9:52 AM] fancy: and if you try to force it
[9:52 AM] fancy: you're just gonna stress yourself out
[9:53 AM] fancy: maybe I gave the wrong impression
[9:53 AM] fancy: but like
[9:53 AM] fancy: do I wish life didn't work that way?
[9:53 AM] fancy: maybe a little bit-but I probably wish that less than I did 2 years ago
[9:54 AM] fancy: because I have more perspective now and maybe there's something to things having finite windows
[9:54 AM] fancy: I don't know
[9:54 AM] fancy: but like
[9:54 AM] fancy: I don't want anything artificial
[9:54 AM] fancy: I've always hated artificiality and facade
[9:54 AM] fancy: it's both boring and unfulfilling to interact with
[9:55 AM] fancy: --
[9:55 AM] fancy: the dota thing isn't personal
[9:55 AM] fancy: I think I've said before
[9:56 AM] fancy: my dota experience these days
[9:56 AM] fancy: is playing with nikki
[9:56 AM] fancy: and putting up with whoever she chooses to invite
[9:57 AM] fancy: I have a really hard time enjoying dota
[9:57 AM] fancy: when I party with people
[9:57 AM] fancy: I think I said this about csgo too
[9:57 AM] fancy: that I get less frustrated when I soloq
[9:58 AM] fancy: but at least I feel like I can talk about dota with nikki in a reasonable way
[9:59 AM] fancy: because she doesn't complain bitterly about how the game is balanced
[9:59 AM] fancy: every other sentence
[9:59 AM] fancy: because it feels like she is as invested in the game as I am
[10:00 AM] fancy: I think you overvalue how much I compliment people and I think you discount how delicate everyone is
[10:01 AM] fancy: I praise jules when he does good because I don't want him to just tilt out and get sullen for the 600th time
[10:01 AM] fancy: I praise yoshi when he does good because I expect little and because he was part of the group that would get really upset when I get annoyed
[10:01 AM] fancy: is it a means to an end?
[10:01 AM] fancy: yeah
[10:01 AM] fancy: it is
[10:01 AM] fancy: but yoshi I don't think gives a fuck about me as a person so I don't really care
[10:02 AM] fancy: and with julian I just want to survive the game without everyone being in a bad mood
[10:03 AM] fancy: I have to be careful praising people like you because of how you act
[10:03 AM] fancy: you say you don't do this
[10:03 AM] fancy: but like
[10:03 AM] fancy: it's very hard for me to tell
[10:03 AM] fancy: if the whole
[10:03 AM] fancy: "justifying a bad play cus it worked" thing
[10:03 AM] fancy: is a meme
[10:03 AM] fancy: or not
[10:03 AM] fancy: because you say you don't actually think that way
[10:03 AM] fancy: and yet
[10:03 AM] fancy: that's not really what I've seen
[10:03 AM] fancy: that's the impression I have at least

I understand why doing something for the sake of spending time, even if you don’t really want to do that thing, can seem kinda odd. I wouldn’t even go so far as to say it’s admirable. It’s not black and white though. Like yeah, I said that I don’t really care to do Gorod or Minecraft that much, but it would be an excuse to play with my best friend. But it’s not like those games are something I resent and am just putting up with. I would still be gaining some personal gratification from those games anyways. And besides, both of those games are less fun when you’re solo anyways. For instance, I don’t plan on picking up MHW, or PAD, just to spend more time with you. I have a line lol. I really don’t care to ever play those games, and you couldn’t make me if you tried x d 

I can understand how the constant dota-related negativity I spurt out can wear on you. I’ve been trying to tone it down. And to be honest, a lot of the issues I had with the game seem to be diminished anyways. I’m not sure if it’s even distinguishable or not, but I have been making a conscious effort to play better. I’d like to say that I’m playing more consistently and more mindfully. At least, that’s what it feels like. I also would like to say that I’m not really mean to you. I think I occasionally make some jokes here and there, but isn’t that just par for the course? No one and nothing is off the table, and I certainly don’t think I’m anywhere near Yoshi’s attitude. I guess sometimes it seems like he and I are ganging up on you, but plenty of times when he takes it further, I don’t participate. Does that make me complicit? Maybe, but these days you’ve been confronting him about it when he’s unnecessarily mean, so I don’t feel the need to intervene. Regardless, I’ll definitely take an effort to be less toxic, and I’ll not bitch about Dota quite so much.
I’m not sure how often I’ve seriously done the whole ‘justifying a bad play cus it worked’ thing. Maybe you could remind me of examples, but I distinctly remember joking about that all of the time. I can’t even recall how many times I’ll do some clownly shit in csgo and it works out, and I’ll talk about how it’s clearly the play or some shit. It’s comedic, at least I think. I tend to carry that over to Dota. And maybe you can’t tell if I’m joking or not because you think I’m so bad at this point that you can’t even tell if I’m being serious. I just want to set this straight. No, I don’t think midas is a good item. No, I don’t think techies is a good or viable hero. No, I don’t really think pudge is a good enough hero to first pick every game. Do I sometimes ignore those things and do what I’m feeling to do? Yeah, sometimes. Doesn’t everyone? (although I haven’t picked techies in an actual game in 8 months or so -_-) Sometimes I pick pudge when I probably shouldn’t. Sometimes I pick storm even when I probably shouldn’t. And if that’s what bothers you, I get that. As I said, I’ve been trying to get away from that recently, and trying to save my “I feel like x hero” games for when I play with people of the spud variety. Or with Mammoth stack, because they’re pretty decent at the game and have a pretty similar attitude. 

Yeah, I’m probably being oversensitive about the ‘compliments’ things. It does feel bad, and I can’t deny that. It feels like I’m being excluded from something and I’m not sure why. I can probably get over it. It’s not even nearly as prominent since you don’t ever want to discord anymore, but it’s still there. Even that shaker game when I saved you on two occasions in 5 minutes, there was never any kudos or thanks or anything. And yeah, I get that at your skill level, that’s probably expected behavior, and I’m probably more proud of those plays than I really should be. But it just feels nice I guess. I always try to give people their due credit because I know how nice it feels to me to get that, and it makes me happy knowing that I’m giving someone else the same thing. It’s not like you have to agree with me on that, but it always felt shitty when you would constantly do it for others, even randies, and never me. I’d hate to see myself as delicate. I just hope you understand where I’m coming from. It’s never nice to feel like you’re excluded from something and not really know why. 


9:58 PM] fancy: u guys are pretty mean to me
[9:59 PM] pizza: can you name an example recently where I was mean?
[9:59 PM] pizza: like, unreasonably so?
[9:59 PM] fancy: the blackops zombies thing is a good example
[9:59 PM] pizza: you mean when all I said was 'you should watch how a professional plays'?
[9:59 PM] fancy: yeah
[10:00 PM] fancy: it wasn't even after I did something wrong
[10:00 PM] fancy: it was kinda just out of nowhere
[10:03 PM] fancy: and the justifying bad plays stuff
[10:03 PM] fancy: it's like
[10:03 PM] fancy: if someone constantly makes racially oriented jokes
[10:03 PM] fancy: like
[10:03 PM] fancy: very frequently
[10:04 PM] fancy: it becomes harder to tell if it's really just a joke
[10:04 PM] fancy: or if they really just want to be racist and it's a good way to mask it
[10:04 PM] fancy: or maybe it's even more subconscious than that
[10:05 PM] fancy: I'm a believer that the things we say and repeat to ourselves/others is who we become
[12:01 AM] pizza: The whole 'this isn't professional gameplay' thing was a pretty fucking memey thing, and I thought that was pretty obvious. Like yeah, you made some mistakes during your ee run, and who doesn't. But that entire thing only really started with me saying 'yoshi you should watch me stream to see how a professional plays.' I don't even think there was a personal attack in there whatsoever, but I could remember incorrectly. You did stream it, so i'm sure there's a vod. Later, idr if it was the same day, we were all in discord and i was streaming kino or some shit, and i was talking about how professional gameplay is wasting all your ammo, spending money on the useless turret, and swapping your good guns for shitty guns. If it still bothered you after that I'm not really sure what else to say.
[12:10 AM] pizza: And yeah, I get the justifying bad plays stuff. I agree with the racist joke analogy. But I would definitely argue that I don't really do that very often, and I find it hard to believe that the times I do it are even possible to interpret as serious. I pretty regularly admit when I think I'm wrong, ask for advice, and acknowledge when I don't really know what I'm talking about (which is pretty common these days in regards to dota). Could you at least remind me of some times when I've done what you're talking about, just so I can get an idea of what in particular bothers you?
[12:28 AM] fancy: I mean you admitted yourself you do the "i knwo this is bad but i am gonna do it anyway" thing
[12:28 AM] fancy: at least sometimes
[12:28 AM] fancy: that counts
[12:29 AM] fancy: and maybe that wasn't that personal of an attack but like
[12:29 AM] fancy: just why
[12:29 AM] fancy: all it could possibly do is make me feel bad
[12:29 AM] fancy: it's not really that funny
[12:29 AM] fancy: there was nothing that happened that made it funny
[12:30 AM] fancy: it was just like
[12:30 AM] fancy: I'm minding my own business
[12:30 AM] fancy: and u walked up and were like
[12:30 AM] fancy: "hah, u know what would be funny, if a real person did that"
[12:31 AM] fancy: also I wasn't there for whatever follow up to that there was
[12:31 AM] fancy: so that doesn't really count for anything
[12:32 AM] pizza: I'm pretty sure there was some inciting incident that caused that
[12:32 AM] pizza: you goofed something idk
[12:32 AM] pizza: it was pretty trivial but there was something
[12:32 AM] fancy: maybe
[12:32 AM] fancy: idk
[12:32 AM] pizza: maybe it was how you don't ever kill panzer and then it fucks you
[12:32 AM] fancy: it just got turned into a meme again
[12:33 AM] fancy: which is mostly yoshi's fault i guess
[12:33 AM] pizza: andi was like
[12:33 AM] fancy: but idk
[12:33 AM] pizza: professional kills panzer
[12:33 AM] pizza: and yeah
[12:33 AM] pizza: you can watch the vod from when i streamed
[12:33 AM] pizza: he was kinda going off
[12:33 AM] fancy: it just makes me sad
[12:33 AM] pizza: and i didn't talk at all
[12:33 AM] pizza: and you even confronted him
[12:33 AM] pizza: and said soemthing about him being mean
[12:33 AM] fancy: yeah I did the thign I do
[12:33 AM] fancy: where I'm really passive aggressive
[12:33 AM] fancy: when people are being mean to me
[12:33 AM] fancy: but like
[12:33 AM] fancy: it doesn't feel like ppl care
[12:33 AM] fancy: so it's more like
[12:33 AM] fancy: im gonna say this
12:33 AM] pizza: that wasn't realy passive aggressive, you kinda just said 'you're being mean'
[12:33 AM] fancy: they're gonna think I'm making  big deal out of nothign
[12:34 AM] fancy: and then I'm gonna leave
[12:34 AM] fancy: maybe passive aggressive was the wrong word
[12:34 AM] fancy: but the thing were I'm like
[12:34 AM] fancy: in a pretty calm tone of voice
[12:35 AM] fancy: "you're just mean to me cus that's hwo it is"
[12:35 AM] fancy: or something like that
[12:35 AM] fancy: and that just makes everything awkward
[12:35 AM] fancy: and that's why I left
[12:35 AM] pizza: understandable
[12:35 AM] pizza: sorry for starting that I guess, I still think I was within the bounds of reason, but i didn't know yoshi would go off the rails with it
[12:36 AM] pizza: it literally started with joking about how you don't kill panzers and ended with me calling out my own shitty plays and how i'm careless. that's where it ended on my path
[12:36 AM] pizza: so i'm not sure what else I could do other than just not tell any jokes around yoshi ever
[12:36 AM] fancy: idn
[12:37 AM] fancy: i just dont' join discord any more
[12:38 AM] pizza: idk if yoshi bothers you that much and makes you sad, why do you still keep him around
[12:38 AM] fancy: what do u mean keep him around
[12:38 AM] fancy: I don't initiate very many things
[12:38 AM] fancy: at all
[12:38 AM] fancy: I don't even ask to watch dnd any more
[12:38 AM] fancy: i just watch by myself
[12:40 AM] pizza: i guess
[12:40 AM] pizza: idk i was never part of that so I didn't notice when it stopped
[12:42 AM] fancy: yeah
[12:42 AM] fancy: like
[12:42 AM] fancy: i don't invite him to things any more
[12:42 AM] fancy: the only thing recently was
[12:42 AM] fancy: the pc building thing
[1:21 AM] pizza: fair enough
[1:22 AM] pizza: also unrelated, but I still don't really get the whole "idk I'll only play with you if nikki chooses to invite you" thing. It's not like you don't have the power to invite me. And if she has a problem playing with me, that'd be one thing. But any time I ask, she lets me join. so that sort of falls under what I said in the first letter, about how I don't want to just be invited out of obligation, just because I asked. I'd rather just be told no
[1:23 AM] pizza: and that was part of the whole 'doing what nikki says' thing I said, with the whoel "she's my manager i only play with who she invites"
[1:23 AM] fancy: what do u mean you don't get it
[1:24 AM] pizza: like if you really wanted to play with me or actually enjoyed playing with me, i'd hope that you would actually take some initiative and invite me if I requested to join, so it makes it hard for me to believe that you actually want to play with you or want me to enjoy the game more
[1:24 AM] fancy: haven't I said that I don't
[1:24 AM] fancy: though
[1:25 AM] fancy: and explained why
[1:25 AM] pizza: don't what?
[1:25 AM] fancy: enjoy playing with anyone that isn't nikki
[1:26 AM] pizza: I guess I'm just not understanding what I'm doing wrong. Like even the last two games we played last night, ,I'm not really sure what I did that can be filed under the "behaviours of people I don't like playing with" category
[1:26 AM] pizza: and if that's just how it is, I can get over it I guess
[1:27 AM] fancy: I mean
[1:27 AM] fancy: yeah those two games weren't bad
[1:27 AM] fancy: but like
[1:27 AM] fancy: that doesn't like
[1:27 AM] fancy: negate
[1:27 AM] fancy: the rest of the time
[1:27 AM] fancy: the complaining and the randomly making midases or picking weird ass heroes
[1:29 AM] fancy: and all the times you and other ppl have gotten upset with me cus I get annoyed when shit is bad

[1:32 AM] pizza: I think i've addressed this many times, but the issue was how you went about it. You would just be toxic. You'd mute yourself and then just type about shit passive aggressively. on one hand, in TAW inhouses you'd at least make some attempt to have some conversation and explain things if you had something to say, and then you'd queue with friends and treat us like shit.

[1:38 AM] fancy: i mean it's the same as the times you wanted to play tf2 and shit and I've had no interest
