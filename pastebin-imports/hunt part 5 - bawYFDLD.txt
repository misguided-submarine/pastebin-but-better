[01:17 AM] A Random Badger: theres no use saying something if theres not a present interest in the conversation which is undeterminable if say, once someone question was satisfied they didnt say anything else
[01:18 AM] A Random Badger: its like
[01:18 AM] A Random Badger: if i said
[01:18 AM] A Random Badger: i like so and so beer
[01:18 AM] A Random Badger: and you asked why
[01:18 AM] A Random Badger: and i said oh because of this flavor
[01:18 AM] A Random Badger: and you said oh ok
[01:18 AM] A Random Badger: even if i wanted to have a conversation about beer
[01:18 AM] A Random Badger: i would view it as
[01:18 AM] fancy: so then what you're really saying is that it's a very shallow topic
[01:18 AM] fancy: either that or
[01:18 AM] A Random Badger: theres not logner a point continuing if theres no interest int the topc
[01:18 AM] fancy: what you should do after that
[01:18 AM] fancy: is ask
[01:18 AM] fancy: "what do you like?"(edited)
[01:19 AM] fancy: and then you can build the conversation  from there
[01:19 AM] fancy: like consider it from the other person's perspective
[01:19 AM] fancy: say I came up
[01:19 AM] fancy: and said
[01:19 AM] fancy: I like apples
[01:19 AM] fancy: and you say why
[01:19 AM] fancy: and I say "cus I like apple pie"
[01:19 AM] fancy: and you say okay
[01:19 AM] fancy: and then I dont' say anything
[01:19 AM] A Random Badger: sure sure
[01:20 AM] fancy: then it would be on me for not taking the topic anywhere
[01:20 AM] A Random Badger: i can turn the question around to someone else
[01:20 AM] A Random Badger: what do you like
[01:20 AM] A Random Badger: and why
[01:20 AM] A Random Badger: but what then
[01:20 AM] A Random Badger: thats still doesnt make it a topic of conversation
[1:20 AM] A Random Badger: all you did was increase the number of questions for 1 to 3
[01:20 AM] fancy: what do you think a conversation is?
[01:21 AM] A Random Badger: well simply answering questions certainly isnt a conversation
[01:21 AM] fancy: it kinda is actually
[1:21 AM] fancy: it's a pretty basic form
[1:21 AM] fancy: like asking just yes or no questions kinda gets old quyickly
[01:21 AM] A Random Badger: its 130 i have to sleep
[01:21 AM] fancy: so generally you don't want to ask those
[1:21 AM] fancy: but yeah most of a conversation is either asking questions or making statements that the other person shares their thoughts on
