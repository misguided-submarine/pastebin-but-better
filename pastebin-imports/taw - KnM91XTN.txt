	Yo are you going to practice today? Davi keeps messaging but I'm not sure...
	Pizza's not on and I don't really want to go if neither of you are. Doing work seems more enjoyable than dealing with the others

[8:17 PM]
shin:
	is there even a lobby lol

[8:17 PM]
negatif.:
	That's what he says
	He hasn't messaged you?

[8:17 PM]
shin:
	unless he can scrounge up the old squad
	it's like not worth my time
	like those games were actually competitive sorta

[8:17 PM]
negatif.:
	This is what he sent me:

[8:17 PM]
shin:
	i think it might have been before your time

[8:17 PM]
negatif.:
	hey man if you can show up tonight thatd be great, weve been having inhouses and i want more of our members to show up if possible
	So why is he bothering me and not you sigh

[8:18 PM]
shin:
	cus I don't answer him
	lol

[8:18 PM]
negatif.:
	Yeah those fire squad things were before I joined

[8:18 PM]
shin:
	yeah back then
	we had real players
	mammoth
	stuvan
	rosz
	ant even tho he was god awful
	and schizo evne tho he's scummy

[8:19 PM]
negatif.:
	I didn't respond for weeks and he kept messaging. I finally responded and told him I was quite busy these days but he's still messaging

[8:19 PM]
shin:
	idn
	i'm sure they've done nothing to improve anything

[8:19 PM]
negatif.:
	So you're not going then?

[8:19 PM]
shin:
	probably not

[8:20 PM]
negatif.:
	I don't expect they've done anything either

[8:20 PM]
shin:
	like
	who's even gonna be there
	it's just gonna be like

[8:20 PM]
negatif.:
	Iono I haven't been in months

[8:20 PM]
shin:
	taro davi and 6 people davi finds in his archon pubs

[8:20 PM]
negatif.:
	Davis like mid ancients now lol
	Somehow

[8:20 PM]
shin:
	nah
	party mmr doesn't count

[8:20 PM]
negatif.:
	I don't think he ever solo qs
	Anyway I think my current playstyle probably suits the time I have these days for dota. So maybe I shouldn't go

[8:22 PM]
shin:
	hanh
	i don't know wha tthat sentence means

[8:22 PM]
negatif.:
	A few games every know and then with Nikki or my other group is enough is what I meant
	Cannot get too hooked like before because I'm slightly behind on my thesis lol
	Now and then*

[8:22 PM]
shin:
	ah
	yeah idn
	taw died basically
	i don't think that those people
	can bring it back
	they're too delusional
	they have no idea what dota evne is

[8:23 PM]
negatif.:
	The clan was too much work. The moment fortes chose davi over pizza to lead the division it was over for me

[8:24 PM]
shin:
	tbh not sure pizza would have been much better

[8:24 PM]
negatif.:
	I realised then that 2 people who were a bit too into being in charge were in charge though

[8:24 PM]
shin:
	i don't even know if that's it
	I'm pretty sure they were all just dumb

[8:24 PM]
negatif.:
	At least pizza didn't care about being in charge

[8:24 PM]
shin:
	or ignorant
	or both

[8:24 PM]
negatif.:
	And had  a brain
	But yes I also didn't really respect anyone who was in charge on an intellectual level
	Hard to believe they'd revive the clan when that's the case
	Or that the people they'd recruit would be people I'd like playing with

[8:26 PM]
shin:
	no one that can play dota would join this league when they could just queue for pubs or be on a real team

[8:26 PM]
negatif.:
	Even if my non-nikki group isn't that skilled they're all compsci or machine learning people so I get along with them alight lol
	For me the games have to be decent or my teammates have to not be annoying
	Cannot deal with both, which is what taw ended up as

[8:27 PM]
shin:
	yeah idn
	game quality dropped really hard
	only so much fun I could have winning every game

[8:27 PM]
negatif.:
	Yeah that makes sense. If I were skilled I wouldn't join taw either

[8:27 PM]
shin:
	like once I figured out
	how to draft for people that can't play
	and agaisnt people that can't play
	then like
	there's not really anything left for me to learn
	keeping the streak alive was kinda neat for a while
	but overall the attitude of basically everyone got really old

[8:29 PM]
negatif.:
	Yeah no one was having fun basically, neither the winning or losing team

[8:29 PM]
shin:
	not only that
	but like
	then it was reinforced
	by the leadership
	being like
	super sugar coated about every game
	because they don't understand how much of a onesided game it was
	like at one point

[8:29 PM]
negatif.:
	Sugar coated?

[8:29 PM]
shin:
	I mentioned
	at the beginning of one practice
	that I'd not lost in like 3 months

[8:30 PM]
negatif.:
	You mean lach? I never took anything he said legitimately

[8:30 PM]
shin:
	and lach chuckled and was like "i'm sure that's not true" as if I was making a like
	cocky joke
	and i'm like no lach literally i have not lose a game
	I don't think people even try any more
	but yeah like
	they just tried to play nice
	lach I mean
	like everything always has to be PC
	and we have ot make sure everyone's feelings aren't hurt
	and it's like
	you can't pretend that a team played well when they obviously didn't
	they picked bad heroes and they played badly
	like there's not much to say
	and if you aren't skilled enough to realize it
	maybe listen to the person that's won every game
	when they say that
	it's not even at all and there's a problem

[8:32 PM]
negatif.:
	Yeah I think for a while we tried to do like advice stuff but no one seemed to want to get better so it never worked

[8:32 PM]
shin:
	no one's ever wanted to improve they all just show up and play
	which is like fine
	but like
	I really don't have anything for those people
	like i just can't do anything with someone that just wants to show up
	and then exist inside a dota game for 35 minutes
	and then flip a coin to see who won
	there's no interesting stories in that, it's just a waste of time and boring

[8:35 PM]
negatif.:
	Yeah makes sense. These days even I don't have much of a desire to improve. I think the rest of life hit me and I realised I should maybe focus on other things
	Although
	That in itself has mellowed me out and these days I just listen to what people say, like whenever I play with Nikki
	Instead of trying to argue or do something else lol

[8:35 PM]
shin:
	yeah everyone has priorities, and that's fine
	but like
	if they're delusional about it

[8:36 PM]
negatif.:
	Unless it's a suggestion like yoshi yesterday when he told me to go boots first
	That was a weird call

[8:36 PM]
shin:
	i don't remember what the situation was

[8:37 PM]
negatif.:
	Iono but after I got buckler and headdress troll couldn't even approach the wave anymore
	So I think I was right

[8:37 PM]
shin:
	oh i'd probably not get buckler
	i'd just get headdress
	and then make phase boots
	actually wait
	no
	you can just

[8:37 PM]
negatif.:
	It saved me twice when I got fissure blocked

[8:37 PM]
shin:
	make headdress
	and
	buy the armour item
	and then get boots
	and then make mek

[8:37 PM]
negatif.:
	That's what I did
	Buckler was the armour item

[8:37 PM]
shin:
	nah
	i wouldn't finish buckler
	I'd just buy chainmail
	from side shop

[8:38 PM]
negatif.:
	It was just the recipe left why not finish it

[8:38 PM]
shin:
	200 gold toward mana boots

[8:38 PM]
negatif.:
	Iono part of it is mental too, like when they fissure blocked me and i activated buckler they stopped chasing lol
	I guess they were just had
	Bad

[8:38 PM]
shin:
	yeah they were
	but yeah paying 200 gold just for +2 armour is kinda eh
	it's not the worst thing in the world

[8:39 PM]
negatif.:
	Although I did actually buy the chainmail and boots from sideshop before buckler but that's only because I didn't want to use courier too early

[8:39 PM]
shin:
	but like on omni boots is nice
	cus u can run at ppl

[8:40 PM]
negatif.:
	Iono troll isn't someone you can run at
	And es was always hiding

[8:40 PM]
shin:
	I think omni can

[8:40 PM]
negatif.:
	He just axes

[8:40 PM]
shin:
	u always out trade him
	ya and u heal on him

[8:40 PM]
negatif.:
	He axes and runs

[8:40 PM]
shin:
	ya that's fine

[8:40 PM]
negatif.:
	He never manfought back

[8:40 PM]
shin:
	if he has boots and u don't you let him have more space
	if he doesn't buy boots then u don't have to
	but if he has boots and you don't, he'll can get cd he doesn't deserve
	cs*
	since u can't punish

[8:41 PM]
negatif.:
	I mean after lvl 4 he stopped farming anyway. I think it went alright
	Nikki even voted for me which was a first

[8:41 PM]
shin:
	yeah like I said not the worst thing
	but like
	in a higher mmr game
	these things matter

[8:42 PM]
negatif.:
	Yeah that makes sense. I have gotten super lazy about small things
	And usually just say, eh it's okay at my mmr to be lazy about last hitting sometimes lol
	Not a great excuse but like I mentioned I just haven't been focused on getting better
	Maybe after my confirmation interview
	Anyway I told davi I'm probably busy so I guess that's that lol
