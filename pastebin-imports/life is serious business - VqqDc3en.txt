[8:26 PM] A Random Badger: after last night im back to my anxious self
[8:26 PM] A Random Badger: how great
[8:27 PM] A Random Badger: feelsgood
[8:27 PM] fancy: anxious about what lol
[8:27 PM] A Random Badger: playing dota or anything
[8:28 PM] fancy: life is less serious than u make it out to be sir
[8:28 PM] A Random Badger: between bad game and bad days of work and stuff
[8:28 PM] A Random Badger: is hard
[8:28 PM] A Random Badger: life is very serious
[8:28 PM] A Random Badger: i think
[8:29 PM] fancy: why do you think it's serious
[8:39 PM] A Random Badger: limited amount of time, value to society, etc
[8:39 PM] fancy: that's some
[8:39 PM] fancy: really vague things
[8:39 PM] fancy: you'd need to elaborate
[8:40 PM] A Random Badger: like, literally life is a limited amount of time and in the amount of time you are basically obligated to contribute in some way to society and depending on the vlaue of the contribution the better life you will live
[8:40 PM] fancy: says who
[8:41 PM] fancy: you're not obligated at all to contribute to "society"
[8:41 PM] fancy: that's just some bullshit people say
[8:41 PM] fancy: cus they feel like life needs a purpose
[8:41 PM] fancy: or some shit
[8:44 PM] A Random Badger: its not even necessarily the purpose of life, its just the fact that society is more or less in a sense what you have to take from in order to live a happy life in my eyes and that relationship is a give and take one, if you just try to take, society will stop giving without getting anything in return. the more you give, the more you get. if you just ignore society and dont contribute to it at all then you're left with nothing because you will not get anything from anyone to make your life meaningful and happy.
[8:45 PM] fancy: that's like
[8:45 PM] fancy: kinda a twisted perception of how things actually are
[8:45 PM] fancy: like
[8:45 PM] fancy: just because you have to trade value if you want things
[8:45 PM] fancy: doesn't make it "serious"
[8:46 PM] fancy: and looking at it super serious like doesn't actually help anything
[8:46 PM] fancy: like yeah some things you have to take seriously
[8:46 PM] fancy: laws, workplace rules, etc
[8:46 PM] fancy: but like
[8:46 PM] fancy: life is way more casual
[8:46 PM] fancy: there's no final exam
[8:46 PM] fancy: no one is judging you
[8:46 PM] fancy: are the end
[8:46 PM] fancy: and gonna be like
[8:46 PM] fancy: hey
[8:46 PM] fancy: u did bad
[8:46 PM] fancy: and if people do that along the way
[8:46 PM] fancy: well
[8:46 PM] fancy: we call those people
[8:47 PM] fancy: insecure assholes
[8:47 PM] fancy: so like yeah if you want sheep you're gonna have to trade some cows
[8:47 PM] fancy: but like
[8:47 PM] fancy: that's so not a big deal
[8:47 PM] fancy: it's not even something to worry about
[8:48 PM] A Random Badger: it is if you dont have much to give, because that means you dont get much in return
[8:48 PM] fancy: what
[8:48 PM] fancy: that doesn't make it more serious lol
[8:48 PM] fancy: people can provide value in lots of ways
[8:48 PM] fancy: if like
[8:49 PM] fancy: you think you need "stuff" to be happy
[8:49 PM] fancy: that's pretty wrong
[8:49 PM] fancy: I'm happy
[8:49 PM] fancy: I don't have a lot of things
[8:49 PM] fancy: I have very few things actually
[8:49 PM] fancy: if you don't have enough to trade for what you want
[8:49 PM] fancy: then just
[8:49 PM] fancy: go get some more things
[8:50 PM] fancy: you have the same time everyone else does
[8:50 PM] fancy: we're all equal
