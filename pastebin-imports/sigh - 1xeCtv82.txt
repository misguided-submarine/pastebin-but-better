[12:49 AM]
pizza.:
	it's the same thing?

[12:50 AM]
FnC:
	its always repeats

[12:50 AM]
pizza.:
	okay

[12:50 AM]
FnC:
	I don't think you actually care

[12:50 AM]
pizza.:
	so you think i suggest games i want to play and then remain engaged in poker and play seriously because.... why exactly

[12:50 AM]
FnC:
	no
	about anything I say
	about things that bothe rme

[12:51 AM]
pizza.:
	idk what I did to you today

[12:51 AM]
FnC:
	thus why I don't htink you care
	or try to understand

[12:51 AM]
pizza.:
	so

[12:51 AM]
FnC:
	or think I have valid feelings

[12:51 AM]
pizza.:
	what happened today
	that pushed you over the edge
	into fantasy land
	where i don't care
	so asking you what's wrong
	and apologizing when i mistep
	*misstep
	and taking clear effort to improve
	shows i don't care
	or try to understand
	contrasted with your usual approach of "i'm not gonna say antyhing if pizza seems bothered he must just be going through a phase"
	yeah
	definitely me who doesn't care
	you cracked the fucking case
	i have noc lue what i did today
	i suggested games
	and i played poker until it became a joke
	and then i left
	i talked to badger about what you guys talked about
	how no one's showing interest
	and i don't see how my actions would reflect that at all
	maybe julian and yoshi who didn't say a fucking word when we asked for suggestions

[12:54 AM]
FnC:
	oh my god
	I don't want to explain it again
	everything is pulling teeth
	all the time
	I'm tired of it
	I'm done

[12:55 AM]
pizza.:
	give up
	it's fine
	woudln't be the first time

[12:55 AM]
FnC:
	nice
	nice cheap shot

[12:55 AM]
pizza.:
	me reaching out and taking an effort clearly doesn't mean anythign to you
	it's never you reaching out
	never
	and you can't say that you've not done anything to hurt me in 8 years
	it's always me who has to start this
	because it always seems like i'm the only one who cares
	your approach is ALWAYS "i'm just gonna leeave him alone he must be going through a phase"
[12:56 AM]
FnC:
	then maybe neither of us cares

[12:56 AM]
pizza.:
	speak for yourself lol

[12:56 AM]
FnC:
	asking what you did wrong and then not changing
	is not caring

[12:56 AM]
pizza.:
	still haven't said
	what i did today

[12:56 AM]
FnC:
	I told you I'm tired of having to run everything

[12:56 AM]
pizza.:
	or when we played spades
	tha tindicated

[12:56 AM]
FnC:
	I told you im SO sick of it

[12:56 AM]
pizza.:
	that i did nothing to change
	so

[12:56 AM]
FnC:
	and tonight
	you were
	so awful

[12:56 AM]
pizza.:
	?
	what did I do exactly?

[12:56 AM]
FnC:
	oh my god
	mayube if you
	paid attention to anything
	ever
	isntead of always
	being on youtuibe
	cus u don't care enough to pay attention to a fucking conversation

[12:57 AM]
pizza.:
	hwat the fuck are you talking about i wasn't on youtube that entire time
	YOU WERE DEAFENED
	OR MUTED
	THE WHOLE TIME

[12:57 AM]
FnC:
	I don't know what the fuck you do but it's never pay attention to me

[12:57 AM]

	you can't fucking
	leave

[12:57 AM]
FnC:
	THINK HARDER THEN

[12:57 AM]
pizza.:
	and then say
	i wans't paying attention

[12:57 AM]
FnC:
	I LEFT AFTER I GOT UPSET

[12:57 AM]
pizza.:

	like when you thought you won that hand
	at the end
	lol
[12:58 AM]
FnC:

	at the beginning of the fucking game
	after I got up out of bed
	that I went to
	because I have to be fucking mom
	ALL THE FUCKING TIME
	IM DONE

[12:58 AM]
pizza.:
	i never had to be notified of my turn, the most i deferred was the movement of the fucking blind chips, and it was usually because you chose to move them immediatley

[12:58 AM]
FnC:
	you're
	so tunnel visioned
	you didn't even listen
	to what I said
	oh my godI don't want to explain it againeverything is pulling teethall the timeI'm tired of itI'm done
	I told you I'm tired of having to run everything
	because I have to be fucking mom

[12:59 AM]
pizza.:
	so you're upset because you have to host and set everything up

[12:59 AM]
FnC:
	yes
	and beg people to choose something
	and then
	fucking
	you come back with
	"no one has chosen anything"
	AS IF
	IM THE ONLY PERSON FUCKING ALLOWED
	TO CHOOSE SOMETHING

[12:59 AM]
pizza.:
	badger could
	nikki could

[12:59 AM]

[1:00 AM]
FnC:
	WHEN I SAID THAT THIS BOTHERS ME

	fucking
	no one else will take charge
	I'm tired of doing it
	I'm done babying everyone
	you guys can run ur own shit

	nikki actively messages me
	what she wants to do
	but you never fucking pick shit
