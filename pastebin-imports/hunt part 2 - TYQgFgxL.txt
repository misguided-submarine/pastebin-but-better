[00:23 AM] A Random Badger: let me counter your question about
[00:23 AM] A Random Badger: gaining an advantage for future games
[00:23 AM] A Random Badger: with a question
[00:24 AM] A Random Badger: i have to figure out how to phrase this tho
[00:24 AM] fancy: just say something
[00:24 AM] fancy: and if it doesn't make sense
[00:24 AM] fancy: I ask
[00:24 AM] fancy: like that's what I do I rephrase what other people say to make sure I understand it
[00:24 AM] A Random Badger: well its very vague in my head and im trying to put it together into a sentence
[00:25 AM] A Random Badger: yanno what no i think its wrong
[00:25 AM] A Random Badger: nvm
[00:25 AM] fancy: what
[00:25 AM] fancy: just ask lol
[00:25 AM] fancy: questions can't be wrong lol what
[00:25 AM] A Random Badger: yes you gain an advantage in future games sure by doing well in a previous one
[00:26 AM] A Random Badger: theres your simple answer
[00:26 AM] A Random Badger: so
[00:26 AM] A Random Badger: w.e
[00:26 AM] A Random Badger: even tho
[00:26 AM] A Random Badger: i think
[00:26 AM] A Random Badger: theres a lot more to it
[00:26 AM] fancy: what does that even mean
[00:26 AM] fancy: "there's a lot more"
[00:26 AM] A Random Badger: because just because you win
[00:26 AM] A Random Badger: doesnt mean everyone else lsot
[00:26 AM] A Random Badger: you can only really say you lost
[00:26 AM] A Random Badger: if you died
[00:26 AM] fancy: right
[00:26 AM] A Random Badger: but just ebcause someone won
[00:26 AM] A Random Badger: doesnt mean you died
[00:26 AM] fancy: but doing better nets you more reward, yeah?
[00:27 AM] fancy: which means progression is either tied to performance, time spent, or a combination
[00:27 AM] fancy: yeah?
[00:27 AM] fancy: obv you can die and lose some progression
[00:27 AM] A Random Badger: yes but this is where i would say its all about skill
[00:27 AM] A Random Badger: because someone who goes into a game
[00:27 AM] A Random Badger: very reckless
[00:27 AM] A Random Badger: and dies
[00:27 AM] A Random Badger: well yea
[00:28 AM] fancy: that would be performing badly
[00:28 AM] fancy: lol
[00:28 AM] A Random Badger: they played bad
[00:28 AM] A Random Badger: they dont gain shit
[00:28 AM] fancy: but if you play well several games in a row
[00:28 AM] fancy: you accrue an advantage out of game, yes?(edited)
[00:28 AM] A Random Badger: wym by accrue
[00:28 AM] A Random Badger: does it like
[00:28 AM] A Random Badger: add up you mean?
[00:28 AM] A Random Badger: does your advantage get cumulatively bigger by winning more?
[00:29 AM] fancy: you earn money by completing objectives in the game
[00:29 AM] fancy: yes?
[00:29 AM] A Random Badger: wait
[00:29 AM] A Random Badger: hold on
[00:29 AM] fancy: I'm rephrasing
[00:29 AM] fancy: what i mean foryou
[00:29 AM] A Random Badger: is that your question
[00:29 AM] fancy: I'm stepping you through it
[00:29 AM] fancy: so yeah, you earn money?
[00:29 AM] A Random Badger: no answer this for
[00:29 AM] A Random Badger: first
[00:29 AM] A Random Badger: oes your advantage get cumulatively bigger by winning more?
[00:29 AM] A Random Badger: is that what you were asking
[00:29 AM] fancy: okay I'm answering that question
[00:29 AM] fancy: sorta
[00:29 AM] A Random Badger: okay
[00:29 AM] A Random Badger: i can answer that
[00:29 AM] A Random Badger: no
[00:29 AM] A Random Badger: it doesnt
[00:29 AM] fancy: that doesn't match up with anything in the manual
[00:29 AM] fancy: for the game
[00:30 AM] A Random Badger: but heres the thing
[00:30 AM] A Random Badger: theres a cap
[00:30 AM] A Random Badger: so to speak
[00:30 AM] fancy: yes there's a cap
[00:30 AM] fancy: but a newly recruited character
[00:30 AM] fancy: is objectively inferior
[00:30 AM] A Random Badger: and theres not like  bigger and better more expensive traits and items
[00:30 AM] fancy: to one you've fully kitted out
[00:30 AM] fancy: yes?
[00:31 AM] A Random Badger: this is where i would say,
[00:31 AM] A Random Badger: if
[00:31 AM] A Random Badger: 2 players / teams
[00:31 AM] A Random Badger: are with equal skill
[00:31 AM] fancy: okay so in every discussion about this
[00:31 AM] A Random Badger: one team has more equipments
[00:31 AM] A Random Badger: and one has only base characters
[00:31 AM] A Random Badger: i would actually rule
[00:31 AM] A Random Badger: that neither have an advantage over the other
[00:31 AM] A Random Badger: because of the fact
[00:32 AM] A Random Badger: that there are so many other factors involved
[00:32 AM] A Random Badger: cause this isnt a game about
[12:32 AM] A Random Badger: killing each other
[12:32 AM] A Random Badger: theres not something you can buy that will
[12:32 AM] A Random Badger: get you to the boss any faster than someone else
[12:33 AM] A Random Badger: different items and loadouts synchronize with different strategies so to speak
[12:33 AM] A Random Badger: but i wouldn't say any of those strategies are
[12:33 AM] A Random Badger: better than another
[00:33 AM] fancy: so
[12:33 AM] fancy: that's not really how this works
[12:33 AM] fancy: right
[12:33 AM] fancy: you can't just say "oh well the advantage doesn't caount because the game has other parts"
[12:33 AM] fancy: it's strictly speaking an advantage
[12:34 AM] fancy: if you are able to purchase different gear that lets you do other strats
[12:34 AM] fancy: or have more utility
[12:34 AM] fancy: that's more or less an advantage you can only gain by playing beforehand
[12:34 AM] fancy: aka
[12:34 AM] fancy: take two accounts
[12:34 AM] fancy: one has a fully leveled and upgraded hunter
[12:35 AM] fancy: and every gear optino available
[12:35 AM] fancy: and the other one
[12:35 AM] fancy: is just created brand new
[12:35 AM] fancy: and take two equally experienced players
[12:35 AM] fancy: will they have an equal playing field
[00:35 AM] A Random Badger: i think so
[12:35 AM] A Random Badger: because
[00:35 AM] fancy: so then there is no progression
[00:35 AM] A Random Badger: let me explain rq
[00:35 AM] fancy: in your opinion
[12:36 AM] fancy: yeah?
