[12:42 AM] A Random Badger: no my atos purpose on nightstalker is at least somewhat viable. sb does not need one cause he has an initiation tool. i get atos on nightstalker so he can initiate ganks and fights more frequently and cleanly at day time instead of just night time. especially in consideration that low mmr bracket doesnt know how to work around night time and frequently likes to go late game, being able to consitently gank and win fights even during the day with atos carries nub low mmr teams. sb just charge, he need no atos, dumb item, if he wants bracer, he should build drum. and the only reason i highly value bracer to clarify is because it is probably the best, cheap strength component that can build into potential items for some heroes. Brewmaster would love a drum if he can, low mmr day time ns would love atos. i would get urn on ns if i needed to keep an enemy from blinking away, other than that i dont really prefer it over atos on ns, even if it delays aghs cause as i said, low mmr dont know how to play around ns aghs and night time anyways, so i'd rather push an advantage asap by fighting during day time and night time that way my team has gold and space to carry the rest of the way. that is my logic behind atos ns and i think it's perfectly sound.
[12:47 AM] A Random Badger: the whole point of atos is to carry the early game not just 'support'. i wanna get kills and gold and push leads until my team can take over and i can sit back and do support things with vision and aghs and gem and be tanky with the stats that i get from atos+aghs
[12:47 AM] fancy: badger have u ever heard of the term
[12:47 AM] fancy: joke
[12:47 AM] A Random Badger: i know but i never got a chance to like

[12:48 AM] A Random Badger: behind atos
[12:48 AM] A Random Badger: okay did you even read it or do you not care
[12:48 AM] A Random Badger: do you agree with my mentality now or no
[12:49 AM] A Random Badger: or am i just dumb still
[12:51 AM] fancy: I'm not engaging lol
[12:51 AM] fancy: I accept that this is ur opinion
[12:53 AM] A Random Badger: I mean it's only for this mmr bracket lol I agree that it wouldn't work in higher mmr when team knows how to work around night time and fast aghs and also don't allow you the amount of money needed for fast atos and aghs
[12:55 AM] A Random Badger: W.e tho
[12:55 AM] fancy: I accept this is ur opinion
