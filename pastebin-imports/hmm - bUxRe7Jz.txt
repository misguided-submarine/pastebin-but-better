[12:31 AM] A Random Badger: regardless i dot see the point in going back to dota unless i somehow reclaim my enthusiasm for it which rn is through the attempt of avoiding everything dota related
[12:31 AM] fancy: it's ur life bud
[12:32 AM] fancy: I can only offer invitations
[12:32 AM] fancy: I can't make you do anything
[12:35 AM] A Random Badger: i mean problem is if its not fun for me then why do it
[12:35 AM] A Random Badger: like the l4d2 invites, i just dont find the game all that fun
[12:35 AM] fancy: have you ever played versus
[12:35 AM] fancy: you've never joined us lol
[12:35 AM] fancy: like
[12:35 AM] fancy: you're free to not join
[12:35 AM] fancy: but if you always decline every invite to everything we do
[12:35 AM] fancy: you can't ocmplain that no one wants you around
[12:36 AM] fancy: like that doesn't make sense
[12:36 AM] fancy: we don't invite you because we're feeling sorry for you lol
[12:36 AM] fancy: we invite you because we want you to join
[12:36 AM] A Random Badger: i have joined once for campaign and ive watched versus on stream and it kinda looks meh
[12:36 AM] A Random Badger: i like starcraft and rts but no one plays those things
[12:37 AM] A Random Badger: all the other games i enjoy other people dont enjoy
[12:37 AM] fancy: there are people out there than enjoy them badger lol
[12:37 AM] A Random Badger: meh not really
[12:38 AM] A Random Badger: i tried stirring up people on reddit and other discord for brood war and stuff for days
[12:38 AM] A Random Badger: got nothig
[12:38 AM] A Random Badger: nothing*
[12:39 AM] A Random Badger: people are only interested in other people who are good at those kinds of games
[12:41 AM] A Random Badger: same with sc2 when i played that
[12:41 AM] A Random Badger: only other choice is
[12:41 AM] A Random Badger: clans and stuff like taw
[12:41 AM] A Random Badger: but taw doesnt have many people who play these types of games anymore
[12:42 AM] fancy: those are pretty fundamentally asocial games
[12:42 AM] fancy: but like
[12:42 AM] fancy: that doesn't mean there aren't people out there
[12:43 AM] fancy: I could go make a post on r/dota2 right now looking for people to play with
[12:43 AM] fancy: and the chances I find anyone worth playing with are like
[12:43 AM] fancy: very small
[12:43 AM] fancy: but that doesn' tmean they're not out there

StarCraft: Brood War â€¢ r/broodwar
The best subreddit for the latest StarCraft: Brood War news and discussion.

[12:44 AM] fancy: http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/brood-war/521980-how-to-get-into-bw-for-sc2-peoples
[12:44 AM] fancy: You're in the right place! Teamliquid.net has people, reddit has people, and of course, you can meet people on battle.net. Team games and "Use Map Settings" (UMS - essentially mini-games) games are a good way to just to have fun and figure out how the game feels. You can even grab some of your irl friends and say, "Hey, let's play versus computers" if you feel like humans are too scary.
[12:44 AM] fancy: they are out there to find
[12:44 AM] fancy: but if you look once and fail
[12:44 AM] fancy: and then give up
[12:44 AM] fancy: iduno man
[12:45 AM] A Random Badger: i mean i made several posts on reddit and team liquid forum and i joined the sc discord and got like nothing and was like whelp fuck you guys then guess im going back to sc2
[12:48 AM] A Random Badger: i sleep
[12:43 PM] fancy: I feel like that's a bad response
[12:43 PM] fancy: as we all know the saying is
[12:43 PM] fancy: if at first you don't succeed, fuck everyone, they're obviously assholes
[12:43 PM] fancy: I hope you can see the imbalance in what you expect vs what you do
[12:44 PM] A Random Badger: but its not "at first" more like at 5th lol how many times are you expected to keep trying without coming up with any results
[12:45 PM] fancy: until you succeed lol
[12:45 PM] fancy: you know how many "best friends" I had to go through to find pizza
[12:45 PM] fancy: you know how many groups I had to go through to still be disappointed by taw
[12:46 PM] fancy: and then on top of that people change
[12:46 PM] fancy: life is a moving target
[12:47 PM] fancy: like if you're hoping you find "the one" answer and then you're set
[12:47 PM] fancy: that's not how life works
[12:48 PM] fancy: pizza and I still fight sometimes
[12:48 PM] fancy: we disagree
[12:48 PM] fancy: we have to take breaks from each other
[12:48 PM] fancy: on paper we're not remarkably compatible
[12:48 PM] fancy: but we're friends because we make it work
[12:48 PM] fancy: we put effort into it
[12:48 PM] fancy: we humor each other
[1:07 PM] A Random Badger: When it comes to things like this though it is entirely based on luck and your effort will never be proportional to what you get out of it. Taking the time to continuously attempt to succeed at something so inherently based on luck will not somehow increase your chances for each time you fail. That's what I call wasted time. There's no point spending time and effort trying to bring people into your life when it all depends on how lucky you are anyways. It's better to just wait it out and do what you want and eventually, one way or another, maybe, and I emphasize maybe because there is always the chance it could never happen, you succeed, you find someone you get along with, whether that's that 1 opponent you keep running into on the ladder in starcraft 1v1s and a rivalry develops, or you meet someone on your dota team that for some reason you just have the feeling to want to communicate in voice with people and that 1 person ends up adding you and you play multiple games together and develop a friendship over the course of time, or of course, that could never happen, it is entirely possible it could not. But spending the effort to forcibly try to meet people on reddit or smth, even tho you could just be doing something you enjoy like playing starcraft, will never increase your chances, because effort is not proportional to success is many things. That's what luck is and it is the only thing I have faith in is that luck will always be there to influence everything and there's nothing that can be done to control it so you just gotta go with it.
[1:14 PM] A Random Badger: So I'll just play starcraft and stuff and maybe I get lucky and make a friend. Or maybe I dont, who knows. Posting a few times on reddit and in discord servers during those times I wasn't doing anything else was worth it sure but I'm not going to put the time aside to keep up those attempts.
[1:23 PM] fancy: Iduno man, people don't just stumble into success if they refuse to treat people right or put effort in
[1:23 PM] fancy: if you want to live life waiting for mana and quail to fall from the sky into your lap
[1:24 PM] fancy: you still gotta actually get up and pick it up
[1:24 PM] fancy: if you were truly happy playing alone you wouldn't complain about not having friends
[1:24 PM] fancy: you have the power to make friends
[1:24 PM] fancy: today
[1:24 PM] fancy: right now
[1:24 PM] fancy: they're not going to be perfect
[1:24 PM] fancy: they're not going to be universal
[1:25 PM] fancy: that's just not how life works
[1:25 PM] fancy: but it's your choice
[1:25 PM] fancy: you don't find people if you don't look
[1:25 PM] fancy: all the people I found, I found because I looked(edited)
[1:33 PM] fancy: like if you're holding out for one day a knight in shining armour
[1:34 PM] fancy: youre choosing a long lonely life(edited)
[1:34 PM] fancy: and you don't have to
[1:34 PM] fancy: nothing in life comes for free
[1:35 PM] fancy: random encounters are exceptions, not the rule
[1:48 PM] A Random Badger: Why can't I send message hold on
[1:48 PM] A Random Badger: Must be too long
[1:49 PM] fancy: I proffer the using enter instead of period option
[1:49 PM] A Random Badger: Friendship still has to have a basis of mutual enjoyment though and sure there's enjoyment in stupid little things like ratz and l4d2 and the occasional dota game. But these are not things I'm interested in and the things I want to be able to do and enjoy with friends I don't have that opportunity because those friends do not enjoy those things. Dota was one of the few things we had that we shared mutual enjoyment and interest in but that went crashing down on my side so I'm not quite sure what you expect me to do. Like up until a few months ago I was enjoying dota by only playing offlane and my blink initiation heroes. I didn't really play anything else. However I started enjoying that less because it became an unreliable role to be able to win games with, or at least with my blink initiation style heroes that I played there so I thought I'd branch out.
[1:49 PM] A Random Badger: So I tried Furion which I figured would be a better hero for carrying teammates and have more impact while also not having to learn a new lane from scratch. I did my research, I practiced a bit in bots (as unreliable as that is) and then I tried bringing it into games with you guys and occasionally in soloq and obviously, since the hero had such a drastically different playstyle and complexity than I was used to, I struggled a lot, but of course expectations from fucking everyone were through the roof expecting me to be able to execute him at 3k level when that was an unrealistic expectation, and it made me reaaally uncomfortable so I tried to just have fun and calm my nerves so I could focus but of course that got thrown in my face that I didn't give a shit about anything but meme value. So what do you know, I gave up entirely on furion and lost a shit ton of interest in the game. Same story with trying to learn mid and stuff. And even though you guys love to throw in my face that I didn't listen and ignored every tip and what not I still attempted to put that into practice. For example, the whole split pushing mentality that you tried teaching me, or the not farming camps with shrapnel as sniper, etc a lot of those things I remembered but instead I was disrespected and undervalued and treated like shit so I stopped caring and wasn't alnble to have fun anymore.
[1:50 PM] A Random Badger: No cause then that usually just ends in me getting interrupted
[1:50 PM] A Random Badger: Before I get to send everything I'd like to say
[1:51 PM] fancy: yeah except you didn't even get the split pushing thing properly
[1:51 PM] fancy: because I never actually explained how or why
[1:51 PM] fancy: and badger if people are telling you it doesn't feel like you're listening
[1:51 PM] fancy: you can't just insist you are
[1:51 PM] fancy: I don't care if you're bad
[1:51 PM] fancy: I've never cared
[1:51 PM] fancy: I care if you talk big when you're bad
[1:51 PM] fancy: I care if you don't listen
[1:52 PM] fancy: I care if you choose to be bad
[1:52 PM] fancy: if you look at every complaint I have about the people I play with
[1:52 PM] fancy: it's all about attitude
[1:52 PM] fancy: I love playing with Julian when he's enjoying himself
[1:52 PM] fancy: I don't like playing with him when he decides he doesn't want to be there
[1:53 PM] A Random Badger: You right so let me just be uncomfortable all the time and preform even worse AND not be able to enjoy myself
[1:53 PM] fancy: if you aren't able to be okay if you're doing bad that's a you problem
[1:53 PM] fancy: we all have bad games
[1:53 PM] fancy: we all struggle
[1:53 PM] fancy: I lost my first 8 arc warden games in a row
[1:53 PM] fancy: we understand having bad games
[1:53 PM] fancy: we understand trying to learn something
[1:53 PM] A Random Badger: That's not the issue
[1:55 PM] A Random Badger: The issue is I get flamed when I'm trying to learn something because of blind expectation that I'm supposed to be able to preform just as well as I can with my comfortable heroes and that makes me uncomfortable so how would you propose I prevent myself from becoming uncomfortable with being flamed at and shit? I can lose a shit ton of soloq games and be flamed by randoms while learning something new and be fine, I can't when I'm with supposed friends
[1:57 PM] A Random Badger: That's my issue and why I find it so hard to enjoy dota anymore. It'd be one thing if I felt like I was being presented genuine advice to improve rather than being flamed.
[1:58 PM] fancy: we don't flame you for fucking up we flame when you're making bullshit excuses
[1:58 PM] A Random Badger: That's not entirely true or at least it certainly doesn't come off that way
[1:58 PM] fancy: badger saying "just stun him!" isn't flaming
[1:59 PM] fancy: I get animated when you tell me all these reasons why you couldn't
[1:59 PM] fancy: because I don't want to deal with that
[1:59 PM] fancy: I don't care why you think you couldn't
[1:59 PM] fancy: all I care is that you know when a man walks under your tower tanking shots you should just stun him
[1:59 PM] fancy: and then we move on with life
[2:00 PM] A Random Badger: Of course you don't because you have squat respect for any genuine thought process I might be having.
[2:00 PM] fancy: i "flamed" pizza the other day because he didn't dive a tower
[2:00 PM] fancy: you know what he said
[2:00 PM] fancy: "yeah probably I didn't even think of that"
[2:00 PM] fancy: and we moved on
[2:01 PM] fancy: badger "I don't play mid and I'm slow to react" isn't a useful thought line to me
[2:01 PM] A Random Badger: Yea and then after so many mistakes you mute and leave because you're mad
[2:01 PM] fancy: no
[2:01 PM] fancy: I mute and leave when you give repeated bullshit excuses
[2:01 PM] fancy: I don't mute and leave because of play
[2:01 PM] fancy: I do because of what people say
[2:01 PM] fancy: ask pizza about it
[2:01 PM] A Random Badger: I'm starting work and it's busy I'll respond later
[2:14 PM] fancy: I don't know know why you think I'm expecting great things from you
[2:14 PM] fancy: I'm expecting fundamentals
[2:14 PM] fancy: I don't expect you to lane properly or be in the right places or have good items
[2:15 PM] fancy: I expect you to know basics like
[2:15 PM] fancy: when enemies dive you you stun them
[2:15 PM] fancy: when ur trying to kill something you cc it
[2:15 PM] fancy: you should use items when you buy them
[2:15 PM] fancy: you should know what heroes do
[2:15 PM] fancy: everyone that's 3k should know those things
[2:15 PM] fancy: they should know how the game works
[2:16 PM] fancy: they don't need to know the nuances of different lanes
[2:16 PM] fancy: or subtle mechanics
[2:16 PM] fancy: or have good camera control
[2:16 PM] fancy: or have gamesense
[2:16 PM] fancy: but you should know how the game works and have a general idea of what to do
[2:39 PM] A Random Badger: Sure but I do not know all of these things yet
[2:41 PM] A Random Badger: The only reason I can potentially play at high level 3k is because I can play blink initiation offlane heroes with relative ease. Other things I'm not good at especially when it comes to fragile heroes or carry heroes
[2:47 PM] fancy: if you don't know those things you're not actually playing at that level lol
[2:55 PM] A Random Badger: Then stop expecting me to be able to
[2:56 PM] fancy: then stop saying you're that level
[2:56 PM] fancy: believe it or not I believe things people say
[2:56 PM] fancy: unless proven otherwise
[2:56 PM] fancy: and also listen to me lol
[2:59 PM] A Random Badger: I'll just play starcraft cause I'm no good at Dota lol. And I was never the one to start saying I was 3k this is what other people were calling me so I'm like okay
[3:04 PM] fancy: people also call me 1k and a stubborn ass
[3:04 PM] fancy: people are bad at accurately assessing things
[3:22 PM] A Random Badger: Yes
[3:23 PM] A Random Badger: So what is point in conversation?
[3:23 PM] fancy: ?
[3:23 PM] fancy: what do you mean
[3:23 PM] fancy: what's the point in conversing?
[3:24 PM] fancy: what's the point in debating?
[3:24 PM] fancy: I debate to find truth
[3:24 PM] fancy: I converse to build relationships
[3:25 PM] A Random Badger: No I mean what is the point of this conversation sorry, not in
[3:25 PM] fancy: I mean you said people told you you were 3k lol
[3:26 PM] fancy: but you blindly accepted it without knowing what that meant
[3:26 PM] fancy: I was refuting that
[3:26 PM] fancy: if you're talking about the point of this conversation in general
[3:26 PM] fancy: I've been sharing things I learned about life
[3:26 PM] fancy: and we've been talking about stuff
[3:26 PM] fancy: that's what friends do badger lol
[3:26 PM] fancy: like if you see no value in it
[3:27 PM] fancy: then I mean
[3:27 PM] fancy: that's just the point I'm making about
[3:27 PM] fancy: you're gonna be hard pressed to find friends if you hate talking because it's 'a waste of time'
[3:27 PM] fancy: me and pizza stay up late often talking about random shit that doesn't matter
[3:27 PM] fancy: like whether ai is gonna advance
[3:28 PM] fancy: talking about spooky ghost stories
[3:28 PM] fancy: or movies
[3:28 PM] fancy: is it practical? not at all
[3:28 PM] fancy: should we have gone to bed?
[3:28 PM] fancy: probably
[3:28 PM] fancy: did it build our relationship?
[3:28 PM] fancy: yes
[3:29 PM] fancy: you say all the time how you just want people to chill and hang with
[3:29 PM] fancy: what do you think that looks like?
[3:32 PM] A Random Badger: I mean I meant cause this whole thing felt more like an argument than anything plus I'm not entirely convinced that everything is better and we're friends again
[3:38 PM] fancy: badger the only thing that's changing is your perspective
[3:38 PM] fancy: I see you the same as I always have
[3:43 PM] fancy: arguments don't need to be combative
[3:54 PM] fancy: it's not about winning it's about finding what's right
[3:54 PM] fancy: I've never argued to win
[3:54 PM] fancy: I just have strong convictions
[3:54 PM] fancy: and people struggle to match me
[3:54 PM] fancy: because they believe things loosely
[4:12 PM] A Random Badger: I mean I still think dotas been ruined for me and I'm still upset about that so I'm still not coming back to it for at least a month. Rn I'm only really interested in brood war and sc2 so unless people want to join me for that I'm still just gonna stick to myself probably
[4:13 PM] fancy: Like I said
[4:13 PM] fancy: it's up to you what you want to do
[4:13 PM] fancy: however
[4:13 PM] fancy: it's your choice
[4:13 PM] fancy: because people aren't excluding you
[4:15 PM] A Random Badger: Never necessarily gelt excluded. Just don't enjoy playing dota with you guys or in general anymore
[4:15 PM] A Random Badger: Felt
[4:15 PM] fancy: that's not what you said tho
[4:15 PM] fancy: you always say how you don't feel like people want you around
[4:17 PM] A Random Badger: No I said I felt like I wasn't a priority or of any great value to anyone other than for a laugh sometimes
[4:18 PM] fancy: same thing
[4:18 PM] fancy: if youre expecting someone to value you more than everyone else always
[4:18 PM] fancy: you're not looking for friends
[4:18 PM] fancy: you're looking for a wife lol
[4:18 PM] fancy: because otherwise that's unrealistic
[4:19 PM] fancy: I'm not even pizzas first priority
[4:19 PM] fancy: nor is he mine
[4:38 PM] A Random Badger: That's not necessarily true and that's not the extent I mean. It's one thing to be friendly with someone and invite them to things like how dally does occasionally but I'm not an actual good friend of her based off how she has other people she's quicker to invite to games and stuff rather than me. Same thing with you guys. You'll always have a list of people who are good friends that you'll always invite and then a backup list of people you're friendly with if your friends aren't available
[4:42 PM] fancy: false ?
[4:42 PM] fancy: unless you consider me and pizza to be primary and then the rest of you second lol
[4:44 PM] fancy: we stopped inviting you because you always declined
[4:44 PM] fancy: like who else do we invite to dota before you lol
[4:50 PM] fancy: and like you seem to expect to just skip all the building steps to friendships
[4:51 PM] fancy: you don't just suddenly become best friends overnight
[4:55 PM] fancy: when you make new friends you don't get promoted instantly(edited)
[4:55 PM] fancy: it's a process
[4:56 PM] fancy: especially if you're not aggressively dedicated to being as open as possible
