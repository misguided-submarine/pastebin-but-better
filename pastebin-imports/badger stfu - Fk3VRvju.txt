[1:19 AM] A Random Badger: ty for satiating my curiosity
[1:19 AM] A Random Badger: lol
[1:20 AM] fancy: I'm more frequently aggressive but less extreme
[1:22 AM] fancy: but yeah
[1:22 AM] fancy: I also only know mostly nikki's side
[1:22 AM] fancy: and I try not to pry
[1:22 AM] fancy: so
[1:22 AM] A Random Badger: well
[1:23 AM] A Random Badger: i got some of both sides
[1:23 AM] A Random Badger: and nikki's definitely seems reasonable
[1:23 AM] A Random Badger: essentially all i know about tyler's side is
[1:23 AM] fancy: tyler is a piece of work that's all I will say
[1:23 AM] fancy: imo
[1:23 AM] fancy: he has a lot of growing up to do
[1:23 AM] A Random Badger: he decided to play scp or smth with another group of friends for an hour
[1:23 AM] A Random Badger: and she just got mad for no reason
[1:23 AM] fancy: I think he has issues with cause and effect
[1:23 AM] fancy: idk
[1:23 AM] A Random Badger: idk
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: but i think
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: nikki's side
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: pairs well with the given messages
[1:24 AM] fancy: nikki is pretty predictable
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: pretty well
[1:24 AM] fancy: at least as far as I have seen
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: so i definitely buy into that more than tyler's
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: cause its definitely clear that like
[1:24 AM] fancy: tyler makes excuses and rationalizations and never owns anything
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: she was angry he broke a promise
[1:24 AM] fancy: he has never apologized to me
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: and then he played dumb and victim
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: which made her mroe angry
[1:24 AM] fancy: for many things he's don eot me
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: ofc
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: so yea
[1:25 AM] A Random Badger: yea i mean
[1:25 AM] A Random Badger: all i know
[1:25 AM] A Random Badger: is from his behavior on his dumb stream
[1:25 AM] A Random Badger: which is
[1:25 AM] A Random Badger: quite shit
[1:25 AM] A Random Badger: imo
[1:25 AM] A Random Badger: lmao
[1:27 AM] fancy: not a very smart individual
[1:27 AM] A Random Badger: yes lmao
[1:27 AM] A Random Badger: anyways
[1:27 AM] A Random Badger: bed time for me
[1:27 AM] fancy: yes
[1:27 AM] fancy: have fun
[1:27 AM] fancy: I am in pain
[1:27 AM] fancy: and dying
[1:27 AM] fancy: woo
[1:27 AM] A Random Badger: ty for indulging me
[1:27 AM] A Random Badger: i would've messages nikki myself probably
[1:27 AM] A Random Badger: but i have her blocked
[1:27 AM] A Random Badger: so
[1:27 AM] A Random Badger: lmao
[1:28 AM] fancy: you dumbass.
[1:28 AM] A Random Badger: well she initially blocked me anyways during our "altercation"
[1:28 AM] A Random Badger: and since she doesnt want to talk to me anymore anyways
[1:28 AM] A Random Badger: its w.e to me
[1:28 AM] A Random Badger: so i blocked her as well
[1:29 AM] fancy: if only there was a way to repair bridges instead of just burning them
[1:29 AM] fancy: wouldn't that be neat
[1:29 AM] A Random Badger: well sure, but idc enough, cause i still have a fairly strong feeling against nikki, and we already went into that in detail
[1:30 AM] A Random Badger: no point reiterating
[1:30 AM] A Random Badger: and i dont see a point repairing that bridge either
[1:30 AM] A Random Badger: cause i dont gain anything from it
[1:30 AM] fancy: and u couldn't POSSIBLY be wrong
[1:30 AM] fancy: xd
1:32 AM] A Random Badger: well i disagree, like i exclaimed before, i still think her not really helping to communicate and just dming you instead was still part of the issue and the fact that she wouldn't even allow me to dig into it so i could try to mend everything so we could still play tabletop as the person who planned on taking over control since no one else wanted to is a big oof from me
[1:34 AM] fancy: you didn't like my answer before you won't like it now
[1:35 AM] fancy: you don't accept the tried and true method of working on the major issue before the minor issues
[1:35 AM] fancy: or the ideology of being diplomatic
[1:35 AM] fancy: so
[1:35 AM] fancy: not much I can do to convicne you of their usefulness
[1:35 AM] fancy: you'll just have to live more and experience more things
[1:44 AM] A Random Badger: well as i tried explaining last time, this was before even i knew she was at least messaging you, and i my mind she was just as guilty as everyone else so she was part of the overlying major issue, so ofc i was gonna lecture her as well
[1:44 AM] A Random Badger: it wasn't until after all was said and done that we got into our conversation
[1:44 AM] A Random Badger: which had it happened sooner, i may have spoken to nikki differently
[1:45 AM] A Random Badger: especially with the knowledge that she at least was messaging you
[1:45 AM] A Random Badger: then i only would've been like hey yanno, im trying to get everyone to communicate, and you only messaging fancy doesnt really help towards that goal
[1:45 AM] A Random Badger: and it would've been a lot better
[1:46 AM] A Random Badger: but that opportunity wasn't available at the moment, when i was under the only presumption that she was just as guilty as everyone else
[1:46 AM] A Random Badger: so ofc i was going to treat and question her
[1:46 AM] A Random Badger: as everyone else
[1:47 AM] A Random Badger: and ofc i turned up the heat with my aggressiveness when she insisted on not just letting me talk to her about the situation and just wanted to be a vague and a bitch for asking her questions
[1:47 AM] A Random Badger: and the fact that she got offended
[1:47 AM] A Random Badger: is a big her problem
[1:47 AM] fancy: LOL
[1:47 AM] fancy: ok
[1:47 AM] fancy: good luck with that
[1:49 AM] A Random Badger: well she was never my friend to begin with so idc lmao
[1:49 AM] A Random Badger: i suffered no loss as far as i can tell imo
[1:50 AM] fancy: no one will be if you give them baggage before you meet them
[1:50 AM] A Random Badger: wym baggage
[1:50 AM] fancy: you like to read way into people
[1:50 AM] fancy: when you don't know much
[1:51 AM] A Random Badger: i knew all i needed to know for the given situation lol
[1:51 AM] fancy: that's
[1:51 AM] fancy: really arrogant
[1:51 AM] fancy: lol
[1:51 AM] A Random Badger: well
[1:51 AM] A Random Badger: i knew there was an issue with communication
[1:51 AM] fancy: and so clearly the response is to get as angry as I was
[1:51 AM] fancy: lol
[1:51 AM] A Random Badger: i knew, at the time, that everyone including nikki was part of that problem
[1:51 AM] fancy: no
[1:51 AM] fancy: you thought you knew
[1:52 AM] fancy: you didn't have all the information
[1:52 AM] fancy: you were wrong
[1:52 AM] fancy: simple
[1:52 AM] A Random Badger: well that was information you neglected to feed me when i told you i was going to talk to everyone about the issue, because it was only information that you knew, so ofc i had to go in with what knowledge i had
[1:53 AM] A Random Badger: which meant that nikki was included in part of the problem
[1:53 AM] fancy: I didn't give you informatino about anyone
[1:53 AM] fancy: but you assumed I gave you everything
[1:53 AM] fancy: you didn't even ask about people specifically
[1:53 AM] fancy: you just
[1:53 AM] fancy: started acting
[1:53 AM] A Random Badger: i believe i specifically talked to you about what i was planning on doing for quite a bit before i actually acted
[1:54 AM] A Random Badger: because i also said that i was thinking about
[1:54 AM] A Random Badger: just bringing it up publicly in discord
[1:54 AM] A Random Badger: before i mentioned just talking to everyone individually
1:54 AM] A Random Badger: you told me what the issue was
[1:54 AM] A Random Badger: and that you were done doing what you were doing
[1:54 AM] A Random Badger: i told you i owuld step up
[1:55 AM] A Random Badger: and that i would talk to everyone who was part of the issue
[1:55 AM] A Random Badger: with the given information
[1:55 AM] A Random Badger: i have no other conclusion to come to
[1:55 AM] A Random Badger: other than
[1:55 AM] A Random Badger: nikki was part of the issue
[1:55 AM] A Random Badger: just as much as yoshi and julian and pizza
[1:56 AM] A Random Badger: but you never took the opportunity to say
[1:56 AM] fancy: https://puu.sh/DfSKp/d1853cc08f.png

[1:56 AM] fancy: you didn't even show me what you were gonna say
[1:56 AM] A Random Badger: "well at least nikki messaged me and told me what to do"
[1:56 AM] fancy: and you were definitely still aggressive
[1:56 AM] A Random Badger: my intial message was a lot more aggressive
[1:56 AM] A Random Badger: and i did send it to you
[1:56 AM] fancy: yikes
[1:56 AM] A Random Badger: but i changed my mind
[1:56 AM] A Random Badger: and deleted it
[1:57 AM] A Random Badger: and decided it was best to message people individually
[1:57 AM] A Random Badger: and just question them on their opinions and feeligns about the situation
[1:57 AM] A Random Badger: and i actually wasn't aggressive with anyone else
[1:58 AM] A Random Badger: and the only reason i was remotely aggressive with nikki was because of the way she curved me when i tried talking to her and gave me a completely vague answer about wanting to continue playing
[1:58 AM] A Random Badger: and then not wanting to elaborate when i asked about what she meant
[1:58 AM] A Random Badger: there was nothing remotely aggressive in any of my messages to anyone up to that point
[1:59 AM] A Random Badger: and that was when i started getting messages from you
[1:59 AM] A Random Badger: because she cried to you cause i offended her
[2:00 AM] A Random Badger: which again, is a big her problem
[2:01 AM] A Random Badger: because nothing aggressive or offending would've been said or taken if she would've just spoke to me about the situation
[2:01 AM] A Random Badger: so i could come to a conclusion on how to handle it
[2:02 AM] A Random Badger: but yes im the sole guilty party in this situation because i was "mean" to someone who refused to just fucking talk to me
[2:02 AM] A Random Badger: i bed now
[2:02 AM] A Random Badger: ty for coming to part 2 of my ted talk
[2:02 AM] fancy: badger you rationalize until you're right
[2:02 AM] fancy: it's not very interesting
[2:02 AM] fancy: as far as I've ever known you never admit your'e wrong
[2:02 AM] fancy: that's all I have to say
[2:03 AM] fancy: yoshi gave you a vauge answer too
[2:03 AM] fancy: you just hate qwomen for some reaosn
[2:03 AM] A Random Badger: i never got back to yoshi because i was in the middle of dealing with you and nikki
[2:03 AM] A Random Badger: when i got his message
[2:03 AM] A Random Badger: and also
[2:03 AM] A Random Badger: i asked him to elaborate
[2:03 AM] A Random Badger: which he did
[2:04 AM] A Random Badger: at least
[2:04 AM] A Random Badger: and then he proceeded to ignore me
[2:04 AM] A Random Badger: at which point, if things had gone differently with nikki at least
[2:04 AM] A Random Badger: and she just talked to me
[2:04 AM] A Random Badger: i could've dealt with yoshi
[2:05 AM] A Random Badger: and if he insisted on ignoring me and not having a discussion about the issue
[2:05 AM] A Random Badger: i would've told him that he wouldn't be invited to tabletop if i was running it
[2:06 AM] A Random Badger: and i only admit when im wrong when its actually quite clear that i am wrong, and i actually have done that with you in the past
[2:06 AM] A Random Badger: a few times
[2:06 AM] A Random Badger: when we've gotten in arguments
[2:06 AM] fancy: can you go back to ignoring me please
[2:07 AM] A Random Badger: and when was i ignoring you lol
[2:08 AM] fancy: the last like two weeks
[2:08 AM] A Random Badger: i wasn't "ignoring you"
[2:08 AM] A Random Badger: we've been playing different games lol
[2:08 AM] A Random Badger: especially since tabletop dream fell apart
[2:08 AM] A Random Badger: tf
[2:09 AM] A Random Badger: and i still havent been too too interested in play mhw
[2:09 AM] A Random Badger: other than that we have been playing very different games lol
[2:12 AM] A Random Badger: anyways if we're not going to discuss the situation further, which i dont really think either of us want to do because we have very different opinions on it and aren't willing to budge on them at all, im going to bed
[2:12 AM] A Random Badger: goodnight
