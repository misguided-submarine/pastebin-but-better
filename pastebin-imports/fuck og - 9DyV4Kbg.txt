11:07 PM] Blairin: why don't you want
[11:07 PM] Blairin: this megachad team
[11:07 PM] Blairin: of og to win
[11:07 PM] fancy: because they're filthy disgusting human beings
[11:07 PM] Blairin: :)
[11:07 PM] fancy: notail is a coward and ceb is fucking toxic as shit
[11:07 PM] Blairin: wym notails a coward
[11:13 PM] fancy: "i don't want to talk about fly it's personal"
[11:13 PM] fancy: then gives him death glare during handshakes????
[11:13 PM] fancy: excuse me ????
[11:13 PM] fancy: is he 12????
[11:13 PM] fancy: fucking deal with ur shit
[11:13 PM] fancy: or don't
[11:13 PM] fancy: dont' make drama
[11:14 PM] Blairin: wym dude was he supposed to just punch him right there? it's obvious he dislikes him and he doesn't want to make drama
[11:14 PM] fancy: you don't give people death glares during handshakes
[11:14 PM] fancy: unless you're making it public
[11:14 PM] fancy: and you can't have it both ways
[11:14 PM] fancy: that was creating drama
[11:15 PM] Blairin: bruh i'm sure notail was the one creating drama when eg is shoulder checking him in the halls
[11:15 PM] fancy: back stage = main stage confirmed
[11:15 PM] fancy: idk
[11:15 PM] fancy: this isn't an interesting discussion
[11:16 PM] fancy: I dont' like notail
[11:16 PM] fancy: and I don't like ceb
[11:16 PM] fancy: and I don't like topson
[11:16 PM] Blairin: i'm sorry nikki told me ur gonna stop playing dota when og wins
[11:16 PM] Blairin: they're like wings 2.0
[11:16 PM] fancy: except
[11:16 PM] fancy: not
[11:16 PM] Blairin: 99% chance they win
[11:16 PM] fancy: because wings
[11:16 PM] fancy: was actually
[11:16 PM] fancy: a team of friendship
[11:16 PM] fancy: this team is not
[11:16 PM] fancy: this team gets carried by ana
[11:17 PM] Blairin: i disagree dogson does great half the games
[11:17 PM] fancy: and half the time he feeds his lane
[11:17 PM] Blairin: he comes back tho
11:17 PM] fancy: because he gets infinity space
[11:17 PM] fancy: he just runs around
[11:17 PM] fancy: clowning
[11:17 PM] fancy: while ana wins the game
[11:18 PM] fancy: like the fact that ceb tried to pass their team off as "loyal friends that stuck together" when they were goign nowhere until ana came back and they swapped a player literally right before ti
[11:18 PM] fancy: is fuckign retarded
[11:18 PM] fancy: like fuckin
[11:18 PM] fancy: talk about your success
[11:18 PM] fancy: but don't spread toxic as shit messages
[11:19 PM] fancy: success isn't dependent on loyalty
[11:19 PM] fancy: that's bullshit
[11:19 PM] fancy: success is built off talent, preparation, anda  little bit of luck
[11:19 PM] fancy: fucking loyalty means nothing
[11:19 PM] fancy: toxic as shit
[11:19 PM] fancy: don't encourage peopel to stick with things that are clearly not working just because "loyalty"
[11:21 PM] Blairin: that seems about standard for an rtz fan
[11:21 PM] fancy: i mean sure
[11:21 PM] fancy: like I said this isn't going to be an interesting discussion
[11:22 PM] Blairin: i'm just sayin
[11:22 PM] fancy: i don't know what you're sayin
[11:22 PM] Blairin: you do as your idols do
[11:22 PM] fancy: what abotu what I just said
[11:22 PM] fancy: has anythign to do with artour
[11:22 PM] Blairin: because artour did the same shit from ti4-ti7
[11:22 PM] Blairin: and every time he swapped off the teams, they would do amazingly
[11:22 PM] fancy: how is that relevant
[11:23 PM] Blairin: i'm saying, if you think loyalty
[11:23 PM] Blairin: has no purpose
[11:23 PM] fancy: loyalty does not = success
[11:23 PM] Blairin: you might want to look at people who constantly teamswap and see how their teams do when they leave
[11:23 PM] fancy: ok
[11:23 PM] fancy: liquid
[11:23 PM] fancy: how did that go
[11:23 PM] fancy: they stuck together longer than any othe rteam
[11:23 PM] fancy: and eventually fell off
[11:23 PM] fancy: there's way more to success
[11:23 PM] fancy: than just loyalty
[11:24 PM] fancy: but telling people your success is because of loyalty
[11:24 PM] fancy: and that being your big meme
[11:24 PM] fancy: that's just
[11:24 PM] fancy: misleading
[11:24 PM] fancy: bad information
[11:24 PM] fancy: especially when it wasn'te ven true
[11:25 PM] fancy: 2 of the most important roles changed
[11:25 PM] Blairin: i disagreed with the matumbaman kick in the first place because liquids results weren't even that bad when he was on their team
[11:25 PM] Blairin: they got 2nd in mdl disneyland paris
[11:25 PM] Blairin: even after they kicked matumbaman, same results next tourney before TI
[11:25 PM] Blairin: 2nd place to a different team
[11:26 PM] fancy: they fell off before matu kick
[11:26 PM] fancy: vp have fallen off
[11:26 PM] Blairin: maybe not loyalty, but cohesion is an important part of the team, and that's a subproduct of loyalty
[11:26 PM] fancy: can be
[11:28 PM] fancy: but dont' spread bad information
[11:28 PM] fancy: that makes you teh worst kind of person
[11:28 PM] fancy: in my book
[11:30 PM] Blairin: luck will become less and less important as dota becomes more and more figured out fancy, and then cohesion will become more and more relevant, and loyalty will become an important part of dota. the carries of 2011 look like 4k players to the carries of current year, the only thing left when there are no more last hits to get and no more skillshots to get is the reaction time between players
[11:30 PM] Blairin: maybe some teams are already at that point
[11:39 PM] fancy: i don't see how any of that is relevant
[11:39 PM] fancy: to what my problem with ceb is
[11:40 PM] Blairin: i'm just telling you why he's not completely wrong, loyalty could be important for top teams
[11:40 PM] Blairin: ceb is racist but so are 90% of dota pros
[11:41 PM] fancy: that's like saying that to be a good football player you have to bench a bunch of weight
[11:41 PM] fancy: like
[11:41 PM] fancy: no
[11:41 PM] fancy: good players do that because it helps
[11:41 PM] fancy: but it's not the reason
[11:41 PM] fancy: for the success
[11:41 PM] fancy: it's misinformation
[11:41 PM] fancy: misinformation is the worst thing you can do
[11:41 PM] fancy: in my book
[11:41 PM] Blairin: there are a number of factors that allow a dota team to win, and all top tier teams are at about the same level
[11:42 PM] fancy: that's vacuous
[11:42 PM] Blairin: the slight edge
11:42 PM] Blairin: is all they need
[11:42 PM] Blairin: i guess ur right, this is a very closed discussion
[11:42 PM] fancy: you're trying to make an argument for a symptom being a cause
[11:42 PM] fancy: it's just not true
[11:42 PM] fancy: loyalty can help
[11:42 PM] fancy: but
[11:42 PM] fancy: you can have cohesion
[11:42 PM] fancy: without loyalty
[11:42 PM] fancy: it's possible
[11:43 PM] fancy: you can throw a team together and go win ti in the same year
[11:43 PM] fancy:
see wings
[11:43 PM] fancy:
see last year og
[11:43 PM] Blairin: >see og
[11:43 PM] fancy: it wasn't loyalty
[11:43 PM] fancy: misinformation.
[11:43 PM] fancy: I've never said og aren't good at dota
11:43 PM] fancy: I've said they're horrible people
[11:44 PM] Blairin: but its highly likely that og players would be doing worse if the second they started losing they started rapidly roster swapping
[11:44 PM] Blairin: in that respect they're not wrong
[11:44 PM] fancy: who knows
[11:44 PM] fancy: roster swap
[11:44 PM] fancy: won them last ti
[11:44 PM] fancy: so
[11:44 PM] Blairin: and fly did something to earn that death stare
[11:44 PM] fancy: please
[11:44 PM] fancy: i hope we're never friends if you think that's what friendship is
[11:44 PM] fancy: sticking with someone even though its failing
[11:45 PM] Blairin: if you think rapidly roster swapping wins teams, go look at artours "success"
[11:45 PM] Blairin: there's evidence for both sides
[11:45 PM] fancy: yes
[11:45 PM] fancy: which is hy
[11:45 PM] fancy: condeming either one
[11:45 PM] fancy: is fuckign stupid
[11:45 PM] fancy: and bad information
[11:47 PM] Blairin: one is the absence of action that doesn't actively hurt 4 other players, and one is action that actively hurts 4 other players, and maybe helps one. it's obvious to see why the other is preferred and touted as right.
[11:47 PM] fancy: i'm enver fautlign someone for doing somethign that they think is best for them
11:47 PM] fancy: og were not winning with fly
[11:47 PM] fancy: or s4
[11:48 PM] fancy: so tehy left
[11:48 PM] fancy: seems reasonable to me
[11:48 PM] Blairin: the contention was never that they left, it's that they did it 1 month before TI and left OG scrambling for a team, that's why it was seen as scummy
[11:49 PM] fancy: because staying when it clearly wasn't working is somehow better?
[11:50 PM] Blairin: No. Leave earlier if you believe that, or see it to it's end, or help find a replacement, don't just send them scrambling for replacements. that's inherently greedy, and unless you're about to turn around and tell me that morality is a spook, you shouldn't do that to people you consider your teammates
[11:51 PM] fancy: yeah I don't believe in that
[11:51 PM] fancy: like riding it out
[11:51 PM] fancy: is a sentiment that sounds nice and all
[11:51 PM] fancy: but like
[11:51 PM] fancy: they weren't gonna win ti
[11:51 PM] Blairin: i don't think fly could win ti on any team
[11:51 PM] fancy: :ASthink:
[11:51 PM] Blairin: bruh tell me i'm wrong
[11:51 PM] fancy: he won ti
[11:51 PM] fancy: alraedy
[11:51 PM] fancy: so
[11:52 PM] Blairin: oh fuck i didn't put fly there
[11:53 PM] Blairin: so you don't agree that it was scummy? you didn't say anything to the other 2 options.
[11:53 PM] Blairin: if it wasn't working out, it's not like it wasn't working out 1 month earlier
[11:53 PM] fancy: no i don't really think it was that scummy
[11:53 PM] Blairin: should've left before TI
[11:53 PM] fancy: i mean maybe the opportunity wasn't there
[11:53 PM] fancy: who the fuck knows
[11:54 PM] Blairin: well, the vast majority of people disagree with you but i doubt you care, that's your opinion.
[11:54 PM] fancy: yeah I know
[11:54 PM] fancy: everyone disagrees
[11:54 PM] fancy: everyone loves notail
[11:54 PM] fancy: i don't
[11:54 PM] fancy: oh well
[11:55 PM] Blairin: high chance of winning TI
[11:55 PM] Blairin: what chance do you think EG has?
[11:55 PM] fancy: not relevant
[11:55 PM] Blairin: they're not relevant to the scene?
[11:57 PM] fancy: no not relevant to this discussion
[11:58 PM] Blairin: i mean what you want me to say? your opinion bad?
[11:58 PM] fancy: uh
[11:58 PM] Blairin: i was just changing the conversation because i know you're a big EG fan and i want to know what you think their chances are
[11:58 PM] fancy: i don't have anythign in particular I want you to say
