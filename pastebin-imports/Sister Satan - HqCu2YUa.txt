6:26 PM] A Random Badger: do you have a comment on my sister's satanism? she says that satanism is the most logical religion xd
[6:27 PM] fancy: that's not a valid sentence
[6:27 PM] A Random Badger: wat
[6:27 PM] fancy: there's no such thing as a logical religion
[6:27 PM] fancy: that's oxymoronic
[6:28 PM] A Random Badger: in the ten commandments, it says not to say gods name in vain, but the fifth satanic rule of the earth is thou shalt not make sexual advances unless given the mating call. Satan says thou shalt not rape, but dont say a dudes name with a shitty attitude
[6:28 PM] A Random Badger: -merle
[6:28 PM] A Random Badger: my sister stole my keyboard
[6:28 PM] A Random Badger: that is her refutation for you saying that
[6:28 PM] A Random Badger: ig
[6:28 PM] A Random Badger: xd
[6:29 PM] fancy: that doesn't address what I said
[6:29 PM] fancy: lol
[6:29 PM] A Random Badger: she says it is logical tho, dont fucking rape people
[6:29 PM] A Random Badger: is her refutation
[6:29 PM] A Random Badger: xd
[6:30 PM] fancy: why not
[6:30 PM] fancy: is my response
[6:30 PM] A Random Badger: because "you weren't given the mating call" ??????????
[6:30 PM] fancy: okay
[6:30 PM] A Random Badger: ?????????
[6:30 PM] fancy: and why is that wrong
[6:30 PM] A Random Badger: she is dumbfounded
[6:30 PM] A Random Badger: hold on
[6:31 PM] A Random Badger: she has never before been asked why
[6:31 PM] fancy: that's because I'm asking for a fundamental justification for rape being bad
[6:31 PM] A Random Badger: "no means no"
[6:31 PM] fancy: and for religion, what that boils down to eventually is some form of "my deity says not to"
[6:31 PM] fancy: and then we ask why is this deity the correct one
[6:31 PM] fancy: and that's a faith based answer
[6:32 PM] fancy: aka: no logical by definition
[6:32 PM] fancy: that's why "logical religion" doesn't make sense
[6:32 PM] fancy: as a phrase
[6:32 PM] fancy: that's all
[6:33 PM] A Random Badger: "most satanists dont believe in satan as a deity but as a, 'a metaphor but not a metaphor' can't think of the word
[6:33 PM] fancy: I think I've heard something like
[6:33 PM] A Random Badger: "they dont see satan as a tangible thing to worship"(edited)
[6:33 PM] fancy: some personification of natural law
[6:33 PM] fancy: or something
[6:33 PM] A Random Badger: she says yes
[6:33 PM] A Random Badger: that
[6:33 PM] A Random Badger: kinda
[6:33 PM] fancy: yea
[6:33 PM] A Random Badger: "it makes sense"
[6:33 PM] fancy: but there's no natural law that says rape is wrong
[6:34 PM] fancy: amongst other things
[6:34 PM] fancy: the natural universe doesn't care
[6:34 PM] A Random Badger: "you got me there"
[6:34 PM] A Random Badger: fancy 1
[6:34 PM] A Random Badger: meryl 0
[6:34 PM] A Random Badger: gg
[6:34 PM] A Random Badger: wp
[6:34 PM] fancy: ya
[6:34 PM] fancy: I mean it's still okay everyone has
[6:34 PM] fancy: basic axioms that they kinda just
[6:34 PM] fancy: believe in without justification
[6:35 PM] fancy: because they like them or they make sense to them or whatever
[6:35 PM] A Random Badger: ye
[6:35 PM] A Random Badger: we've had discussions like this in the past so i knew how this was gonna turn out from the start xd

[6:39 PM] A Random Badger: 1 sec i read this
[6:52 PM] A Random Badger: ah the problem that is being a jordan peterson fan
[6:52 PM] A Random Badger: but yea i agree with one of those comments
[6:52 PM] A Random Badger: who cares
[6:52 PM] A Random Badger: focus on yourself
[6:52 PM] A Random Badger: not your problems to fix someone else

[6:55 PM] A Random Badger: oof
[6:55 PM] A Random Badger: this is good
[6:55 PM] A Random Badger: yea
[6:55 PM] A Random Badger: though partially i think i disagree with the whole relationship vs net personality
[6:56 PM] A Random Badger: cause if a net personality is helping you change to be the person you want and the person you're in a relationship with doesnt support that then yea, fuck that person and that relationship
[6:56 PM] A Random Badger: but everything else is on the mark
[6:56 PM] fancy: I mean if the person u want to be is the person that makes this post
[6:56 PM] fancy: then(edited)
[6:56 PM] fancy: y i k e s
[6:57 PM] A Random Badger: oh im not saying i do
[6:57 PM] fancy: yeah but
[6:57 PM] fancy: I agree
[6:57 PM] A Random Badger: but if thats the person he wants to be power to him
[6:57 PM] fancy: well sure
[6:57 PM] fancy: and then he can be ostracized
[6:57 PM] fancy: wooo
[6:58 PM] fancy: pretty sure jp would say this person is being dumb I don't think he'd want people being so fanatic over him that they can't maintain actual relationships
[6:58 PM] A Random Badger: oh yea prob
[6:58 PM] A Random Badger: obsession i bad thing usually
[6:58 PM] A Random Badger: is*
[6:59 PM] A Random Badger: and the way that he handled his relationship is also bad
[6:59 PM] A Random Badger: xd
[7:00 PM] A Random Badger: but back to the thing i said
[7:00 PM] A Random Badger: religion vs science
[7:00 PM] A Random Badger: um
[7:01 PM] A Random Badger: im kinda really against that whole battle in general, how people will consistently try to use science to disprove one religion or another or vice versa with a person trying to dismiss science entirely in way of religion
[7:01 PM] A Random Badger: and personally
[7:01 PM] fancy: people are stupid
[7:01 PM] fancy: and full of feelings
[7:01 PM] A Random Badger: due to string theory (which ofc i dont have the best understanding of)
[7:02 PM] A Random Badger: i'd personally say we're almost at that point where its impossible in any way for science to disprove religious existences since string theory, if true, would prove the possibility of it and just how impossible it is to actually prove it correct or incorrect
[7:04 PM] A Random Badger: unless we develop the technology to perceive higher dimensions which who knows if that is possible, and even if we do and do discover there are no "souls" or "heaven" or "god"  in up to so much as the 11th dimension
[7:04 PM] A Random Badger: who's to say there isn't more to the universe that we've still yet to discover
[7:04 PM] A Random Badger: this was something i think about a bit especially when people bring up things like
[7:04 PM] A Random Badger: "logic defies the existence of higher beings"
[7:05 PM] A Random Badger: when personally i would say it doesnt really defy that particular thing
[7:05 PM] A Random Badger: only really what you talked about a bit ago
[7:05 PM] A Random Badger: obviously logic does defy religious principles like "my deity told me so and so"
[7:06 PM] A Random Badger: "is bad"
[7:06 PM] fancy: so anyone who says that logic defies the existence of higher beings" is wrong
[7:06 PM] fancy: objectively speaking
[7:07 PM] fancy: and it's pretty easy to demonstrate
[7:07 PM] A Random Badger: yea i mean
[7:07 PM] A Random Badger: >insert classic graph of the universe, with 1 part of our understand and then put a deity outside of it
[7:07 PM] A Random Badger: have you seen that graph-thing?
[7:08 PM] fancy: no
[7:08 PM] A Random Badger: something like "this white board represents the universe, everything in this circle is stuff we understand, and god is probably here outside the circle so its impossible to disprove or prove him because of our lack of understanding of everything outside the circle"
[7:09 PM] A Random Badger: but how would you demonstrate it
[7:09 PM] A Random Badger: thats the way ive seen classically used to demonstrate it
[7:12 PM] fancy: The same way you can't disprove the statement "some dogs are brown" without finding every single dog in existence, past, present, and future
[7:13 PM] A Random Badger: right yea we've discussed this principle before
[7:13 PM] A Random Badger: what is it called?
7:13 PM] fancy: uhh
[7:13 PM] fancy: idk
[7:13 PM] fancy: some basic logic tenant
[7:13 PM] A Random Badger: yea except the previous example we used was a white crow
[7:14 PM] fancy: was this with me
[7:14 PM] A Random Badger: we generally accept that all crows are black but we can't disprove they can't be white
[7:14 PM] A Random Badger: yes
[7:14 PM] A Random Badger: i said something dumb i think once
[7:14 PM] A Random Badger: upon a time
[7:14 PM] A Random Badger: and then we got into this discussion
[7:14 PM] A Random Badger: and the example you used was a white crow
[7:17 PM] fancy: was it me
[7:17 PM] fancy: I don't remember this
[7:18 PM] A Random Badger: yes i am fairly sure
[7:18 PM] A Random Badger: it was last year tho
[7:18 PM] A Random Badger: i think
[7:18 PM] fancy: hmm
[7:18 PM] fancy: where
[7:18 PM] A Random Badger: in your discord i think
[7:19 PM] fancy: nothing about crows there
[7:19 PM] A Random Badger: idk then
[7:19 PM] A Random Badger: but w.e
[7:19 PM] fancy: who knows
