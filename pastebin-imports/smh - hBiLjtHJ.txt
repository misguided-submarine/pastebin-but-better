[3:55 PM] GodHi: when did the mich thing happen
[3:55 PM] fancy: a month or so ago
[3:55 PM] GodHi: makes sense then
[3:56 PM] GodHi: still on recovery from it + the group break up i guess
[3:56 PM] GodHi: :hug:
[3:56 PM] fancy: yeah maybe
[3:56 PM] fancy: idk
[3:56 PM] fancy: I've talked to hax a bunch about it
[3:56 PM] fancy: and like dating in general and stuffs
[3:57 PM] fancy: cus like I'm fairly certain I'm not going to try again
[3:57 PM] GodHi: i mean idk if i'm a good person to talk about it since i'm heavily biased but i agree lol
[3:57 PM] GodHi: i would never edate someone and never will so i agree with your decision but
[3:57 PM] GodHi: hopefully it's one that benefits u
[3:58 PM] fancy: well I meant dating in general
[3:58 PM] fancy: cus to me it's all the same
[3:58 PM] fancy: but I also think my view of relationships is fairly niche
[3:58 PM] GodHi: the problem is that it's not
[3:58 PM] GodHi: as rough as it is to say this
[3:58 PM] GodHi: and as much as i love the cute relationship between nyki and snobell
[3:58 PM] GodHi: e-dating will never be the same as dating
[3:59 PM] fancy: :shrugging:
[3:59 PM] GodHi: i could easily just tell someone shit here that i would never say to a person irl
[3:59 PM] GodHi: it's a wall of text
[3:59 PM] GodHi: a machine and a keyboard
[3:59 PM] GodHi: :shrugs:
[3:59 PM] fancy: I would agree that's often the case yeah
[3:59 PM] GodHi: you can easily just disconnect your heart from the social media and done
[4:00 PM] GodHi: you lie without hurting yourself
[4:00 PM] GodHi: you fake without giving remarks
[4:00 PM] fancy: I treat them the same, but that's just me personally, and I know most people aren't like that
[4:00 PM] GodHi: i mean i'm just giving you my example of experience
[4:00 PM] fancy: ye no I'd agree
[4:00 PM] fancy: I have the same experience
[4:00 PM] GodHi: as to why u shouldn't stop dating bcs edating is hell
[4:01 PM] GodHi: one should be totally separated from the other
[4:01 PM] fancy: well the reason isn't because of edating
[4:01 PM] fancy: it's a lot of reasons
[4:01 PM] fancy: I don't think dating is a good thing for me
[4:01 PM] fancy: any kind
[4:01 PM] fancy: I just like
[4:01 PM] fancy: don't give enough of the right kind of fucks
[4:02 PM] fancy: that either I'm going to be unsatisfied or they will
[4:02 PM] fancy: I've never met anyone who looks at stuff the way I do that isn't also incredibly fucked up
[4:02 PM] fancy: so only a matter of time before I make the connection that looking at things the way i do probably means I'm fucked up
[4:02 PM] fancy: :shrug:
[4:02 PM] GodHi: I feel that you are a bit confused about that concept
[4:02 PM] fancy: wym
[4:03 PM] fancy: it's just pattern recognition
[4:03 PM] GodHi: From knowing you, you obviously care about being unsatisfied or others being unsatisfied
[4:03 PM] fancy: oh
[4:03 PM] fancy: I think phrasing here
[4:03 PM] fancy: so I meant like
[4:03 PM] fancy: I don't give the right kind of fucks, which will lead to either me or the other person being unsatisfied
[4:04 PM] fancy: cus like the stuff I care about and the way I look at things, i've only seen mirrored by people that are super fucked up
[4:04 PM] fancy: and I don't really like people that are super fucked up
[4:04 PM] GodHi: You see
[4:04 PM] GodHi: There’s 2 flaws in that
[4:04 PM] GodHi: What would even be the “right” kind of fuck
[4:04 PM] GodHi: A fuck that you need to give is separate per personality
[4:05 PM] GodHi: And person
[4:05 PM] fancy: yeah that's a fair point, "right" isn't the correct word
[4:05 PM] GodHi: I feel like
[4:05 PM] GodHi: The flow lead you into situations that maybe yourself didn’t want into
[4:05 PM] GodHi: Like
[4:06 PM] GodHi: Think of what you rly liked in mich before FF or atleast before they started dming you
[4:06 PM] GodHi: I know this is bad to ask after a break up but
[4:06 PM] GodHi: do you really feel like you went into that yourself
[4:06 PM] GodHi: Or did the flow lead you to it
[4:07 PM] fancy: well no I never go into it myself
[4:07 PM] fancy: because it always starts with me saying
[4:07 PM] fancy: I don't date
[4:07 PM] fancy: and then I end up dating
[4:07 PM] fancy: and then I'm like well guess I should have listened to myself
[4:07 PM] GodHi: Then probably that’s the reason you got bad experiences
[4:07 PM] GodHi: You see
[4:07 PM] fancy: but even outside of dating, just talking to people it's pretty obvious I value different things than most people
[4:08 PM] fancy: in like a romantic sense
[4:08 PM] GodHi: Love is not a flow that you get into and then decide i’m in love
[4:08 PM] fancy: of what you'd look for in a partner
[4:08 PM] GodHi: It’s more like
[4:08 PM] GodHi: Oh i like this person
[4:08 PM] GodHi: I’m going after her
[4:09 PM] fancy: I mean not necessarily I don't think, just because you weren't the pursuer doesn't mean you can't like/love them based on getting to know them
[4:09 PM] GodHi: I mean ponder about it
[4:09 PM] GodHi: Is that rly true?
[4:09 PM] fancy: yes
[4:10 PM] GodHi: I don’t rly agree
[4:10 PM] fancy: you can only have one pursuer, so this doesn't really work out
[4:10 PM] GodHi: I actually think the reason you got into those sticky situations was not your decision or your actual pursue
[4:10 PM] fancy: if both have to pursue each other that's just nothingness
[4:10 PM] GodHi: But the flow that lead you into comfort
[4:11 PM] fancy: there's always someone who drives the relationship more than the other though
[4:11 PM] fancy: it's like statistically improbable that both parties drive it equally
[4:11 PM] fancy: the best you're gonna get is sometimes it's one person and sometimes it's the other
[4:11 PM] GodHi: Feelings have no statistics lol
[4:12 PM] GodHi: Nor probability
[4:12 PM] GodHi: I can hate you tomorrow and love you yesterday
[4:12 PM] GodHi: Driving a relationship is not a relationship
[4:12 PM] GodHi: Relationship are mutual agreements of feelings
[4:12 PM] GodHi: Not one deciding the path
[4:13 PM] GodHi: :WhenLifeGetsAtYou:
[4:13 PM] GodHi: Getting a relationship driven by your partner is no more than following the flow
[4:13 PM] GodHi: Until you question yourself and say
[4:13 PM] GodHi: “Do i really like this person?”
[4:14 PM] GodHi: That’s atleast imo what happens with you
[4:14 PM] GodHi: But who am i to say that
[4:14 PM] GodHi: :shrugs:
[4:14 PM] fancy: I think we're talking about different things
[4:14 PM] GodHi: Not rly
[4:15 PM] GodHi: I’m talking as to why you probably didn’t have an actual relationship until now from me analysing your patterns and feelings
[4:15 PM] GodHi: But i’m not a deduction god
[4:15 PM] GodHi: Nor a god
[4:15 PM] GodHi: I am but a man
[4:15 PM] GodHi: I just hope you find your truth
[4:15 PM] fancy: yeah that's def not what I was talking about
[4:15 PM] fancy: kek
[4:15 PM] GodHi: I mean
[4:15 PM] GodHi: I was the one that brought the point
[4:15 PM] GodHi: I’m just developing mine
[4:16 PM] fancy: I just responded to when you said
[4:16 PM] GodHi: Not countering yours
[4:16 PM] fancy: "love is more like 'oh i like this person, i'm going after her'"
[4:16 PM] GodHi: Ye
[4:16 PM] GodHi: This entire text i sent is to that remark
[4:16 PM] fancy: when that's not necessarily how it always works logistically
[4:16 PM] fancy: imo
[4:16 PM] GodHi: Bruh
[4:17 PM] GodHi: There’s no logistics in relationships lmao
[4:17 PM] fancy: there def are
[4:17 PM] GodHi: There’s no math, no science other than psychology
[4:17 PM] fancy: :shrug:
[4:17 PM] fancy: difference of beliefs then
[4:17 PM] GodHi: Love at first sight is a thing
[4:17 PM] fancy: I woudlnt' call that love
[4:18 PM] GodHi: It is love
[4:18 PM] GodHi: That’s how inconsistent and random love is
[4:18 PM] fancy: sure if you want to call it that
[4:18 PM] GodHi: Lmao
[4:18 PM] fancy: I wouldn't
[4:18 PM] GodHi: I mean this basic principle you believe is part of what i meant in my text
[4:19 PM] GodHi: I’d say rly inside you don’t rly believe in love but instead in interest that becomes intimacy
[4:20 PM] fancy: I don't believe in your definition of what love is, no
[4:20 PM] GodHi: :shrugs:
[4:21 PM] GodHi: I guess my opinion is just
[4:21 PM] GodHi: To end it all
[4:21 PM] GodHi: Instead of never dating anymore
[4:21 PM] GodHi: Try thinking of what dating rly means to u
[4:21 PM] fancy: I know what dating means to me
[4:21 PM] GodHi: That’s all i want lol
[4:21 PM] fancy: that's why I'm saying
[4:21 PM] fancy: It's not good for me
[4:21 PM] fancy: and I shouldn't do it
[4:22 PM] fancy: because the way I evaluate relationships just doesn't mesh well with other people that I would care to spend time with
[4:23 PM] GodHi: I mean shin does that even make sense in your life pattern
[4:23 PM] fancy: yes it does
[4:23 PM] GodHi: Like think about it lol
[4:23 PM] fancy: it's the pattern of every relationship I've been in
[4:23 PM] fancy: and why I end them
[4:23 PM] GodHi: If it didn’t mesh well your relationships wouldn’t even start
[4:23 PM] fancy: that's not entirely true
[4:23 PM] fancy: you don't know everything about someone immediately
[4:23 PM] GodHi: So let me get it right
[4:24 PM] GodHi: You meet the person
[4:24 PM] GodHi: Talk to them for a while, know a lot about them
[4:24 PM] GodHi: Date
[4:24 PM] GodHi: Then evaluate?
[4:24 PM] fancy: evaluation is a continual process
[4:24 PM] GodHi: Evaluation can be continual pre relationship
[4:24 PM] fancy: nah
[4:24 PM] fancy: it happens always
[4:24 PM] fancy: I evaluate everything all the time
[4:25 PM] GodHi: It seems more like, as i said, you enter the flow and when you reach the end you finally evaluate
[4:25 PM] fancy: i mean
[4:25 PM] fancy: it's only the "end" because that's where it ended
[4:25 PM] fancy: which seems circular
[4:25 PM] fancy: but like
[4:25 PM] fancy: you only view it as me evaluating at the end of the relationships because that's where I chose to end it
[4:26 PM] fancy: but the entire time is a constant evaluation of pros/cons to maintaining the relationship
[4:26 PM] fancy: I just end it when it's not worth it
[4:26 PM] GodHi: No, what i meant with end is when you finally decide to deeply evaluate and discover the relationship wasn’t actually for u
[4:26 PM] GodHi: Not the relationship’s ending
[4:26 PM] GodHi: Flow end > evaluation > void > relationship ending
[4:27 PM] fancy: that would make sense if you could instantly know everything relevant about a person
[4:27 PM] fancy: but that's not really how it works
[4:27 PM] fancy: you learn stuff all the time
[4:27 PM] fancy: new data = new evaluation
[4:27 PM] GodHi: Surely, but what does it cost to learn data before you enter the flow
[4:27 PM] fancy: 80 years
[4:27 PM] fancy: or so
[4:27 PM] fancy: I would say
[4:27 PM] GodHi: Not rly
[4:28 PM] GodHi: Dating is not a tool that instantly makes you intimate with a person lol
[4:28 PM] fancy: uhhh
[4:28 PM] fancy: that was my point
[4:28 PM] GodHi: Yes
[4:28 PM] GodHi: That’s why you
[4:28 PM] GodHi: Get intimacy before dating
[4:28 PM] GodHi: And joining the flow
[4:28 PM] GodHi: Diff views of the same point
[4:28 PM] fancy: yes
[4:28 PM] fancy: and that's what
[4:28 PM] GodHi: You said that would take 80 years
[4:28 PM] GodHi: I say it takes the same time
[4:29 PM] fancy: I'm not going to bother with
[4:29 PM] fancy: anymore
[4:29 PM] GodHi: You truly just said that to end the convo bcs it doesn’t rly make sense on my point but
[4:29 PM] GodHi: I will respect u
[4:29 PM] GodHi: Just a thought :shrugs:
[4:29 PM] fancy: what do you mean
[4:29 PM] fancy: if you want to call it dating or you want to call it intimacy
[4:29 PM] fancy: it doesn't really matter
[4:30 PM] GodHi: It does
[4:30 PM] fancy: the word doesn't matter
[4:30 PM] fancy: if we're talking about the same thing
[4:30 PM] GodHi: Yes they do bcs they are not same things
[4:30 PM] fancy: I don't know how to explain the concept of words not mattering
[4:30 PM] GodHi: Concepts matter lol
[4:30 PM] fancy: yes
[4:30 PM] fancy: and what I jus tsaid was
[4:30 PM] fancy: if we're talking about the same thing
[4:31 PM] fancy: then whatever we call it doesn't really matter
[4:31 PM] GodHi: There is a reason they are separate words with separate concepts
[4:31 PM] GodHi: I can be your friend and know 1000x more things about your secrets than your date
[4:31 PM] fancy: sure
[4:31 PM] fancy: so would you be happier if I said
[4:31 PM] GodHi: Without any interest other than friendship
[4:31 PM] fancy: "i'm not going to be romantically intimate with anyone anymore"
[4:31 PM] fancy: instead of dating
[4:32 PM] GodHi: Huh
[4:32 PM] fancy: what do you mean huh
[4:32 PM] fancy: if I said that instead of saying "i'm not going to date anymore"
[4:32 PM] fancy: would you be happier with that
[4:33 PM] fancy: because that sounds probably closer to the way you'd express what I'm trying to say
[4:33 PM] GodHi: I mean sure I understand
[4:35 PM] GodHi: It’s not rly a solution to the problem im mentioning
[4:35 PM] GodHi: But i’m just gonna stop
[4:35 PM] GodHi: Iz k
[4:35 PM] fancy: wait how is it not a solution
[4:35 PM] GodHi: Shh iz over
[4:35 PM] fancy: the problem I'm trying to address is that I don't believe I mesh well with others
[4:35 PM] fancy: romantically
[4:35 PM] fancy: that is
[4:35 PM] fancy: so I would say that not engaging romantically is a pretty decent solution
[4:36 PM] fancy: outside of like trying to fundamentally change what I value and who I am
[4:36 PM] GodHi: Bruh if u want to actually understand my point just reread in silence and without a discussion “in the zone” mindset
[4:36 PM] GodHi: I don’t rly feel like i can go through you now
[4:36 PM] GodHi: And i don’t want to waste time and friendship on it
[4:36 PM] GodHi: It’s not like i’m fixing your life or solving a problem
[4:36 PM] fancy: my understanding of what you said was that I just let things happen and go with it
[4:36 PM] fancy: becuase it was there, comfortable, and convenient
[4:36 PM] fancy: etc
[4:37 PM] fancy: and I wasn't engaging because I actually saw something I wanted
[4:37 PM] fancy: is that accurate
[4:37 PM] GodHi: Man legit
[4:38 PM] GodHi: I’m telling u to chill and read it l8r if u want
[4:38 PM] GodHi: I know myself that i’ve done it bfr and it works
[4:38 PM] GodHi: Iz easier
[4:38 PM] GodHi: If u don’t care u can just ignore it
[4:38 PM] GodHi: Idm too
[4:38 PM] GodHi: It prob won’t even change your life
[4:40 PM]  GodHi: It’s literally a insight from me, a human that also makes mistakes and also is dumb and can be wrong just like any human, from a deduction i made from the scarce information i have and knowledge from previous interactions with you, mich and your interactions in the past
[4:40 PM]  GodHi: It could be all wrong
[4:41 PM]  GodHi: Don’t mind it that hard lol
[4:42 PM]  fancy: tbf I can't evaluate whether to mind it if I dont understand what you're saying
[4:42 PM]  fancy: Thus my question
[4:42 PM]  GodHi: You don’t need to evaluate
[4:42 PM]  GodHi: You only need to read and ponder if u want
[4:42 PM]  fancy: so u know that
[4:43 PM]  fancy: is another way to describe evaluating
[4:43 PM]  fancy: right
[4:43 PM]  fancy: "pondering"
[4:43 PM]  GodHi: Evaluating is deciding the value
[4:43 PM]  GodHi: Pondering is thinking deeply and searching for the actual meaning
[4:43 PM]  GodHi: Or context
[4:43 PM]  GodHi: They are 100% totally different things
[4:43 PM]  fancy: Ok
[4:44 PM]  GodHi: You can evaluate grammar, you can’t ponder about the meaning of that grammar error
[4:44 PM]  GodHi: Just as an example
[4:44 PM]  GodHi: To clear it
[4:46 PM]  fancy: and you can do neither if you're not speaking the same language
[4:48 PM]  GodHi: Thankfully we are both speaking english
[4:48 PM]  GodHi: Unless you want me to pull some korean
[4:48 PM]  fancy: Then the metaphor is missed on you
[4:48 PM]  fancy: If I don't know what concept you're trying to convey, I can neither ponder nor evaluate nor analyze nor re-tell it
[4:49 PM]  GodHi: The metaphor is pointless if your definition of “not same language” is “i didn’t understand what you meant because i didn’t stop to think about it”
[4:49 PM]  GodHi: “Elaborate for me so i can just say the same thing later”
[4:49 PM]  fancy: do you agree that communication is a two way street
[4:50 PM]  GodHi: Communication is indeed a two way street, i heard your point first then presented my point through this entire time
[4:50 PM]  fancy: that's not what two way street meant at all
[4:50 PM]  GodHi: Zzz shin
[4:50 PM]  GodHi: If all your arguments will be
[4:50 PM]  fancy: ok, so no you don't agree
[4:50 PM]  fancy: that's fine
[4:50 PM]  GodHi: “I don’t understand” “that’s not what it means” and “this is the same for me”
[4:51 PM]  GodHi: I’ll just stop lol
[4:51 PM]  fancy: that's def not my argument
[4:51 PM]  GodHi: Bcs that’s all you did for the entirety of this
[4:51 PM]  GodHi: Kek
[4:51 PM]  GodHi: Then scroll up
[4:51 PM]  GodHi: I can screenshot but i’m too lazy and not interested in this pointless final discussion
[4:54 PM]  fancy: That's fine, I don't think you really care to understand what I was trying to say anyway
[4:54 PM]  GodHi: Nor do you, my friend
[4:55 PM]  fancy: I asked if my interpretation was accurate and you responded with 
[4:38 PM]  GodHi: Man legit
[4:38 PM]  GodHi: I’m telling u to chill and read it l8r if u want
[4:55 PM]  GodHi: Bcs your interpretation is not accurate
[4:55 PM]  GodHi: It’s an almagamation of discussion focus
[4:55 PM]  GodHi: And power to defend your basic principles
[4:55 PM]  fancy: what
[4:55 PM]  GodHi: Made into a biased opinion
[4:55 PM]  GodHi: That’s why I responded that
[4:56 PM]  GodHi: Bcs instead of saying what i just said
[4:56 PM]  GodHi: It’s just better to say what i had said formerly
[4:56 PM]  fancy: honestly that's just dodging all responsibility of the communicator
[4:56 PM]  fancy: if you think I'm just gonna magically interpret the same words differently later
[4:56 PM]  GodHi: Yup
[4:56 PM]  GodHi: You will
[4:56 PM]  GodHi: As we all humans do
[4:57 PM]  fancy: which is all good
[4:57 PM]  GodHi: If there is something i have learned in the entirety of my writing life
[4:57 PM]  GodHi: Is that what you read at first can change entirely just from reading it later or another day
[4:57 PM]  GodHi: A fucking cool story can become a shit text filled with cliches
[4:58 PM]  fancy: Nah it's fine
[4:58 PM]  fancy: we can just move on
[4:58 PM]  GodHi: Indeed
