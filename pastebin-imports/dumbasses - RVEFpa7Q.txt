[4:24 PM] shin (hi): which reminds me I still have alts to finish
[4:24 PM] shin (hi): ugh
[4:24 PM] shin (hi): november is going to be fucking busy for me
[4:25 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Alts?
[4:25 PM] shin (hi): yeah
[4:25 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): You have a problem lmao
[4:25 PM] shin (hi): yes
[4:25 PM] shin (hi): the problem is the fucking tomestone cap
[4:25 PM] shin (hi): and gear restrictions
[4:25 PM] shin (hi): "play every job on one character" my ass
[4:25 PM] shin (hi): biggest lie of my generation
[4:26 PM] shin (hi): do we have a schedule set yet idr if we talked about it
[4:29 PM] F’urytael Katt: The tomestone cap is fine if you don’t use bis. It’s pretty bad if you want bis on every job
[4:29 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I gotta double check but I think we're doing 3 days per week, 3-4 hours each night
[4:30 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I think I posted our potentially schedule on our raid channel
[4:31 PM] F’urytael Katt: The 4.4 crafted gears are pretty horrible for melding. Only one slot and it allows overmeld
[4:32 PM] shin (hi): "fine" is honestly incorrect
[4:32 PM] shin (hi): like
[4:32 PM] shin (hi): it's week 37 or 38, I've capped I believe every week but 2 and I'm missing 3 classes worth of tome gear
[4:33 PM] shin (hi): that's absolutely insane
[4:33 PM] F’urytael Katt: Crafted sets don’t need tomestones and they can still clear new contents
[4:33 PM] shin (hi): huh
[4:33 PM] shin (hi): so?
[4:33 PM] F’urytael Katt: So unless you need bis, the tomestone cap is fine
[4:34 PM] shin (hi): it's not though...
[4:34 PM] shin (hi): like in a tier that's lasted over twice as long as usual, not being able to bis every class should illustrate just how insanely low the cap is
[4:34 PM] F’urytael Katt: It’s there to give players a reason to log in and do stuff every week so they won’t unsub
[4:35 PM] shin (hi): it really doesn't
[4:35 PM] F’urytael Katt: It’s a common trick used by online games I think
[4:35 PM] shin (hi): what it does is gate players from playing multiple jobs
[4:35 PM] F’urytael Katt: Just use crafted sets
[4:35 PM] shin (hi): in a game where that's a huge selling point
[4:36 PM] F’urytael Katt: Crafted sets are more than enough for the savage fights anyway
[4:36 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: You can't argue with shin, F'ury.  He doesn't care about things that humans care about.
[4:36 PM] shin (hi): you can't just use crafted sets for things like ultimates and speed kills
[4:37 PM] F’urytael Katt: I play all jobs and I’m fine with crafted sets plus relic weapons. Unless you really want to do speed clears or 100 parses, bis should be unecessary
[4:38 PM] shin (hi): or ultimates
[4:38 PM] F’urytael Katt: So the real argument is you can’t play all jobs if you want to do speed clears, 100 parses or new ultimates with every job
[4:39 PM] F’urytael Katt: But fine if you do savage or easier contents
[4:40 PM] shin (hi): I heavily disagree, the cap is absurdly low.
[4:40 PM] shin (hi): the fact that in a tier that's over twice as long as normal you still can't afford all the gear for every class should illustrate this
[4:40 PM] F’urytael Katt: But the majority of the contents don’t need those gears
[4:41 PM] F’urytael Katt: And speed clear and 100 parses are not the intended contents for the developers
[4:41 PM] F’urytael Katt: So the only thing that’s a bit problematic is the ultimates
[4:43 PM] shin (hi): By your logic, savage shouldn't even drop gear and tomestones shouldn't exist
[4:44 PM] shin (hi): Also, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the majority of the player base cannot clear turn 4 in crafted gear
[4:44 PM] shin (hi): as in probably 70%+
[4:45 PM] F’urytael Katt: Tomestones exist for ultimates I guess. The savage gears do seem a bit pointless though
[4:45 PM] shin (hi): I'd say probably higher but I'm being conservative
[4:46 PM] shin (hi): And yeah we're just not going to agree. Almost every high end raider I've heard talk about this thinks the cap is way too low for way too long
[4:46 PM] shin (hi): And many people have said they'd play more if they had the ability to gear multiple jobs
[4:46 PM] shin (hi): tomestone cap is not keeping players sticking around longer I would bet money on it
[4:49 PM] F’urytael Katt: They complain about it but they still have to log in to get bis for more jobs. If the bis is too easy to obtain, people will get bis on everything very soon, clear everything with every job, and just stop raiding because they’ve completed them with every job already and have bis already
[4:50 PM] F’urytael Katt: Making things incomplete will make people want more.
[4:53 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): That's only half true. Lots of people stop raiding after their first clear in non bis
[4:54 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): It's an incredibly small percentage, as most raiders get bis gear then do parse runs. But there's still players that stop raiding week 1
[4:54 PM] shin (hi): yeah right now people quit after one BIS or maybe two because it's literally impossible in a normal cycle to get more
[4:55 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Anyways, this should be in #raid-discussion
[4:56 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: It's the same in any game.  The hardest of hardcore players want the resource caps set at levels that would be balanced for people who play the game the way they do.  But 95% of players don't play that way, and developers have to keep the average player in mind when balancing things.
[4:58 PM] F’urytael Katt: There’s another type of hardcore that doesn’t need any bis though: Min ilevel speed clears
[4:58 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Yeah. It's all about balance. Shin is by no means an average player lmao
[4:58 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: I'm aware
[4:59 PM] F’urytael Katt: Bis doesn’t seem that necessary even if you want to do hardcore stuff
[4:59 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I'm on Shins side about wanting the cap raised too but I understand I'm also in the 1% of hardcore raiders. Shin is in the 1% of the 1% of hardcore players that are borderline insane
[5:00 PM] shin (hi): so much for raid channel
[5:00 PM] shin (hi): I tried
[5:00 PM] shin (hi): XD
[5:00 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Lmao
[5:00 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: 'borderline'
[5:00 PM] shin (hi): my issue isn't that there is a cap
[5:00 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Yeah, let's take it to #raid-discussion  please
[5:00 PM] F’urytael Katt: I’m new to the game but I don’t think the tomestone cap should be a problem even for hardcore players. There will always be a way to do hardcore contents without bis
[5:01 PM] F’urytael Katt: You only need to normalize your gears and do speed clears with that
[5:01 PM] F’urytael Katt: min ilevel should be an easy way to do those
4:58 PM] shin (hi): @Braendyn Witherwind so my question for you is what is "balanced" about making a resource that's used in a purely PvE context mathematically impossible to acquire enough of
[4:58 PM] shin (hi): what does "balanced" even mean in this context
[5:00 PM] shin (hi): my issue isn't that the cap exists
[5:01 PM] shin (hi): it's that it's way too low, or lasts way too long
[5:01 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Raid stuff
[5:01 PM] shin (hi): if you wanna cap it for 8 weeks go for it
[5:01 PM] shin (hi): but the fact that in week 40 I can't have every piece of gear I need?
[5:01 PM] shin (hi): that's fucking nutty
[5:02 PM] shin (hi): tiers usually last what like 4-5 months swarles?
[5:02 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: It's balanced because most players will only get the gear for one or two roles.  And if they could do that in 3 or 4 weeks, they'd be done.
[5:02 PM] F’urytael Katt: Most players don’t play every job from what I see
[5:02 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: Your perspective is skewed
[5:02 PM] F’urytael Katt: We are the minority
[5:02 PM] shin (hi): that argument is skewed
[5:03 PM] shin (hi): because you can't play multiple jobs in a tier
[5:03 PM] shin (hi): that's why people have to wait until new tiers to do new jobs
[5:03 PM] shin (hi): hell even if I wanted to swap melee jobs in the middle of a tier there's a 66% chance I can't
[5:03 PM] F’urytael Katt: Only for ultimates speed clears and stuff like those
[5:04 PM] F’urytael Katt: Most contents can be done with multiple jobs just fine
[5:04 PM] F’urytael Katt: And if you happen to not have bis for a certain job. You can just do min ilevel speed clears instead
[5:04 PM] F’urytael Katt: That should still meet your hardcore needs
[5:06 PM] shin (hi): again
[5:06 PM] shin (hi): I would argue that most players cannot do savage in full crafted gear
[5:06 PM] shin (hi): so that argument isn't even valid
[5:07 PM] F’urytael Katt: Those players aren’t hardcore enough anyway
[5:07 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: Most players NEVER clear savage
[5:07 PM] F’urytael Katt: They are not your type
[5:07 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: In ANY gear
[5:07 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Most players can't clear savage in BIS lol
[5:08 PM] shin (hi): around 35% of max levelled characters have cleared ramuh iirc
[5:08 PM] shin (hi): that's a significant amount
[5:08 PM] F’urytael Katt: I mean hardcore players like you should just do min ilevel speed clears. No bis needed at all and it’s very hard to do
[5:08 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: Even on JAP servers, less than half of players clear
[5:08 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): The cap should be increased automatically once you earn the achievement for clearing the tier. That would be fair
[5:08 PM] shin (hi): I like that idea actually
[5:08 PM] shin (hi): but like
[5:08 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): At that point it's very clear you're farming
[5:09 PM] shin (hi): you can't simultaneously argue that the cap is keeping players playing and also that most people don't care about getting said gear
[5:09 PM] shin (hi): the serious raiders are not going to stop playing because they get BIS
[5:09 PM] shin (hi): that's a very small subset of people that clear the tier once and gtfo
[5:09 PM] shin (hi): cap is doing nothing to those players anyway
[5:09 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): But to be fair, 5.4 was supposed to be released in August. You're not meant to be fully BiS on every class in a single tier
[5:10 PM] shin (hi): yeah but that's kinda my issue right
[5:10 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Yeah. I think they should've removed the cap in August when 5.4 was supposed to come out.
[5:10 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): But I don't think the cap should go up overall
[5:10 PM] shin (hi): i'm fine with the cap for the first two months
[5:10 PM] shin (hi): or three months
[5:10 PM] shin (hi): idc
[5:11 PM] shin (hi): don't want to powercreep the tier etc etc whatever
[5:11 PM] shin (hi): but like
[5:11 PM] shin (hi): imagine there had been an ultimate in 5.3 instead of them waiting for 5.5
[5:11 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): When 5.4 comes out they are going to remove the cap on allegory and introduce a new tomestone. So it does make sense that in August when 5.4 was supposed to come out that they removed the cap on allegory
[5:12 PM] shin (hi): players 100% get gated out of doing it at all on certain jobs if they didn't gear them
[5:12 PM] shin (hi): being forced into basically 1 maybe two jobs for an entire tier is a pretty poor representation of "you can play all jobs"
[5:12 PM] shin (hi): what they really mean is "you can play all jobs at a sub par level"
[5:13 PM] F’urytael Katt: Do min ilevel as I suggested
[5:13 PM] shin (hi): "and you're gated from the hardest content"
[5:13 PM] F’urytael Katt: That doesn’t need bis at all
[5:13 PM] shin (hi): that would just be a different BIS
[5:13 PM] shin (hi): lol
[5:13 PM] F’urytael Katt: But those should be easier to obtain
[5:13 PM] shin (hi): I don't like this argument, it's the same as the "just unsub if you're bored lol" argument
[5:14 PM] shin (hi): what positive impact does the tome cap have on the game past week 8 or 12
[5:14 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Shin is a completionist as well though. Irs not just about raiding for him. Getting BiS is apart of getting 100% in the game. At least that's how it looks to me, so I understand his point
[5:14 PM] F’urytael Katt: Also for new players who just got there at week 8
[5:14 PM] shin (hi): what positive impact does it have
[5:15 PM] shin (hi): keep in mind, "keeping players subbed for week after week" is not a positive gameplay impact
[5:15 PM] shin (hi): it's a positive revenue impact
[5:15 PM] shin (hi): but it's not a gameplay improvement
[5:15 PM] shin (hi): "yes log in do expert roulette log out x5 per week" is not exactly good or interesting gameplay
[5:15 PM] F’urytael Katt: Make them log in weekly
[5:15 PM] F’urytael Katt: Yeah but that’s the design philosophy for most game developers
[5:16 PM] F’urytael Katt: Otherwise why do we have weekly and daily gated contents at all
[5:16 PM] shin (hi): so, like I said, positive for revenue, bad for gameplay
[5:16 PM] shin (hi): thus my complaint
[5:16 PM] F’urytael Katt: I agree
[5:16 PM] F’urytael Katt: So they will keep doing this
[5:16 PM] F’urytael Katt: That’s how online games work
[5:16 PM] shin (hi): I only care about gameplay, because as a player, I'm going to be the only one arguing for gameplay over revenue
[5:17 PM] F’urytael Katt: But the developers decide what they do
[5:17 PM] F’urytael Katt: So my argument is they did what they should do in their perspective
[5:18 PM] shin (hi): ok..?
[5:19 PM] F’urytael Katt: And we as players can still adapt to those
[5:19 PM] shin (hi): I'm not arguing about how to adapt to it
[5:19 PM] shin (hi): I still play the game regardless
[5:19 PM] F’urytael Katt: Because it’s almost impossible that they’ll change this system
[5:19 PM] shin (hi): but I will still criticize what I perceive to be a flawed model
[5:19 PM] shin (hi): lol
[5:19 PM] shin (hi): that's a terrible mentality
[5:19 PM] shin (hi): honestly
[5:20 PM] shin (hi): "might as well never complain about this because they probably won't change it"
[5:20 PM] F’urytael Katt: You want a revolution in online game design
[5:20 PM] shin (hi): I want 900 tomes per week
[5:20 PM] F’urytael Katt: Good for you but you’ll need to first get into this industry
[5:20 PM] shin (hi): or the tome cap to be lifted after 8-12 weeks
[5:20 PM] shin (hi): this is hardly revolutionary
[5:21 PM] F’urytael Katt: That’s still a compromise on their side
[5:21 PM] shin (hi): hell, they removed the loot restrictions on savage months earlier than I would have expected them too
[5:21 PM] F’urytael Katt: You need to convince them that it’s better that way
[5:21 PM] shin (hi): I find it more insane they didn't also remove the tomestone cap along with it
[5:22 PM] shin (hi): but my expectation was for them to leave both in until the morning of 5.4
[5:23 PM] F’urytael Katt: Ideally I want online games to have no daily/weekly gated contents. But that would certainly need a revolution
[5:23 PM] shin (hi): honestly if i had it my way, I'd remove tomestone gear completely, I'd make BIS only raid gear, and I'd make savage loot rules the same as normal loot rules
[5:23 PM] shin (hi): I don't mind daily/weekly content
[5:23 PM] shin (hi): I mind mathematically unfair content
[5:24 PM] F’urytael Katt: Allegory is weekly gated contents
[5:24 PM] F’urytael Katt: I also want to do beast tribe quests in one day. But instead I have to take a few weeks
[5:25 PM] shin (hi): I don't think you understand how vastly more reasonable the beast tribe quest limit is compared to allegory
[5:25 PM] F’urytael Katt: They follow the same design philosophy. They just hinder the progress for different kinds of people
[5:25 PM] shin (hi): I'm not arguing with the philosophy
[5:26 PM] shin (hi): I'm arguing with the numbers
[5:26 PM] F’urytael Katt: Ultimates are the only real gated contents
[5:26 PM] F’urytael Katt: Maybe they should make that doable with crafted gears
[5:27 PM] shin (hi): that completely invalidates you saying the tomestone cap is a reason to keep players playing
[5:27 PM] shin (hi): lol
[5:27 PM] F’urytael Katt: It’s a reason to keep a bigger percentage of people playing
[5:28 PM] F’urytael Katt: Not for some of the ultimates players
[5:29 PM] shin (hi): what type of player is going to keep playing purely because of the tomestone cap
[5:29 PM] F’urytael Katt: That’s just one of the reasons
[5:29 PM] F’urytael Katt: It doesn’t have to be the only reason
[5:30 PM] shin (hi): ok
[5:31 PM] F’urytael Katt: Game developers are always trying to make their game more profitable. If something make more people stay and not get too burnt out, they will do it
[5:31 PM] shin (hi): I'm confident that the tomestone cap does not contribute positively to that
[5:32 PM] F’urytael Katt: I’m not sure. I don’t have SE’s statistics
[5:32 PM] shin (hi): that's not even a statistic that can even exist
[5:32 PM] F’urytael Katt: They can try different caps and see which works better. Or do other math that I don’t know yet
[5:33 PM] shin (hi): key would being can
[5:33 PM] shin (hi): they don't
[5:33 PM] F’urytael Katt: As a player we wouldn’t know how their math works
[5:34 PM] F’urytael Katt: They also need to know what each player is doing when they play in order to tell what each player cares about
[5:35 PM] F’urytael Katt: But we as players certainly can’t get access to those numbers, let alone how they do math
