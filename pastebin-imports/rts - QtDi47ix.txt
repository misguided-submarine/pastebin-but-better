[11:33 PM] A Random Badger: i would tell you that if you enjoy fun rts missions and good story and narrative you should play sc2 campaign but you dont enjoy narrative
[11:38 PM] A Random Badger: i prefer macro
[11:40 PM] fancy: macro feels so static and boring to me
[11:40 PM] fancy: it's just like
[11:40 PM] fancy: hey do these things constantly
[11:40 PM] fancy: while also dealing with ur opponent
[11:40 PM] fancy: it's like playing agianst the game vs playing against people
October 15, 2017
[12:32 AM] A Random Badger: yea i can understand that, especially if you dont already have an appreciation and enjoyment for the management and maintence of an army or base/nation on top of the battles themselves
[3:29 AM] fancy: I mean there's nothing to it other than hey here are things you have to keep doing
[3:29 AM] fancy: keep making workers
[3:29 AM] fancy: make buildings
[3:29 AM] fancy: make upgrades
[3:29 AM] fancy: make units
[3:30 AM] fancy: meanwhile try to play the game
[10:19 AM] A Random Badger: That is the game tho lol
[10:30 AM] fancy: eh
[10:30 AM] fancy: game should be to fight enemy not the game
[10:30 AM] fancy: imo
[10:44 AM] A Random Badger: How is it fighting the game tho
[11:12 AM] fancy: cuz I'm playing against the game trying to do things
[11:12 AM] fancy: not against the player
[1:36 PM] A Random Badger: Uh isn't that the same thing as last hitting and having to figure out what items to buy in dota. Those are game mechanics that don't directly impact your opponent but help you to fight them. Maybe just not as tedious and simpler to do for some people.
[1:37 PM] fancy: last hitting is pretty interactive tbh
[1:37 PM] fancy: but items are a one time decision
[1:37 PM] fancy: it's not like I have to keep remembering to make items cus they get used up
[1:41 PM] fancy: like it feels so much like added complication by just throwing more shit at you
[1:41 PM] fancy: and its more about time management or some shit
[1:41 PM] fancy: fuck time management
[1:50 PM] A Random Badger: having to know what production facilities you need to construct and how to compose your army is also pretty interactive. rts is typically a battle of countering one anothers actions. and moba requires just as much time management as well. you have to be able to use time effectively to accumulate a net worth higher enough to kill and outplay your opponents and destory their base. in like low skill leve of rts, sure its uninteractive and it more about who has more shit and who manages time more effectively but the same can be said for the lower skill brackets of dota where its more about accumulating a higher net worth and having more items and making decent engagements compared to higher skill brackets where countering heroes and items and reacting in specific way to the enemy is much more important
[1:50 PM] A Random Badger: both games are very simple and boring in their own ways at low skill levels
[1:50 PM] fancy: yeah but dota doesn't kill ur hands
[1:50 PM] fancy: :^]
[1:51 PM] fancy: like idk rts just feels like the ultimate in bad game design for humans
[1:51 PM] A Random Badger: indeed
[1:51 PM] fancy: cus we can't actually do more than one thing at one time
[1:51 PM] fancy: yet rts is all about doing 50 things simultaneously
[1:51 PM] A Random Badger: hence why rts gamers are the most prevelent with case of carpal tunnel xd
[1:52 PM] fancy: it's like putting square block in round hole
[1:52 PM] fancy: like sure you could drive your car with your feet
[1:52 PM] fancy: but why would you
[1:52 PM] fancy: lol
[1:55 PM] A Random Badger: yea i mean if you dont enjoy multitasking and having to manage a shit ton of different things and being able to do that better than your opponent in order to win then obviously youre not going to have an appreciation for the genre. but i mean moba after all was originally just an ARTS so they still do share many similar concepts and designs only switching the importance of micro and macro cause like theres amcro in dota and such but its about as important as just a-clicking an army across the map is for rts micro
[1:55 PM] A Random Badger: (in lower skill levels of course xd)
[2:00 PM] fancy: macro in dota is just as important I think but it just doesn't require like 4000 extra inputs
[2:02 PM] A Random Badger: hmmm i dont agree. like i think it progressively become more important as you increase in skill level just as micro does in rts but like you can probably just get away with just building whatever tf you want in 1k-2k as long as your fucking rich as balls
[2:02 PM] A Random Badger: fucking go right click lich and that shit would win in 1k with a deso as long as you richer than everyone else
[2:02 PM] A Random Badger: imo
[2:03 PM] A Random Badger: after all i think most 2ks and prob 3k and into 4k typically make bad item choices and decisions but start to get a grasp of the bigger picture and what they should be doing and what they should be buying once they get higher
[2:03 PM] A Random Badger: imo
[2:04 PM] fancy: iduno
[2:04 PM] fancy: this discussion degenerates when you get below 4k
[2:04 PM] fancy: cus those people barely play dota(edited)
[2:04 PM] A Random Badger: djs?
[2:04 PM] A Random Badger: oh lol
[2:05 PM] A Random Badger: yea
[2:05 PM] A Random Badger: well i mean
[2:05 PM] A Random Badger: same thing for rts
[2:05 PM] fancy: autocorrect is ambitious
[2:05 PM] A Random Badger: where i say plat level is prob equivalent to like 4k or 5k where you start to udnerstand what you should be doing
[2:06 PM] fancy: and u still fuck up cus ur dum xd
[2:06 PM] A Random Badger: indeed xd but at least you start to kinda understand
[2:10 PM] fancy: or u make silver edge on alch and get 5 man ganked 8 times
[2:11 PM] A Random Badger: then it just comes down to u dum and arent 4k xd
[2:13 PM] fancy: my 5k player did that @_@
[2:13 PM] fancy: I cried
