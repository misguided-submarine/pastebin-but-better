[11:31 PM] fancy: one day I might understand rpgs
[11:31 PM] fancy: maybe
[11:31 PM] fancy: xd
[11:42 PM] A Random Badger: I enjoy them as brainless as they are sometimes. Mainly stay for the mod ding community tho
[11:44 PM] fancy: I've never been able to get into single player games
[11:46 PM] A Random Badger: Well they are my origin so it's easy for me
[11:46 PM] fancy: only single player game I play is pad
[11:50 PM] A Random Badger: Personally I am just big fan of fallout series
[11:50 PM] A Random Badger: Plus
[11:51 PM] A Random Badger: I would ask that you refrain from referencing fallout 4 as an rpg just so you are aware cause it is no rpg
September 20, 2017
[12:02 AM] fancy: what is it then lol
[12:02 AM] A Random Badger: An action adventure game
[12:02 AM] A Random Badger: With open world
[12:02 AM] A Random Badger: In the fallout setting
[12:03 AM] A Random Badger: I'll refer you to my review if you seek more explanation
[12:06 AM] fancy: idk Wikipedia calls it an rpg
[12:06 AM] fancy: I trust wikipedia
[12:07 AM] fancy: and like u go get to pretend ur a dude that you're not so that's playing a role
[12:07 AM] fancy: and it's a game
[12:07 AM] fancy: sooooo
[12:08 AM] fancy: I disagree with your premise
[12:09 AM] fancy: RPGs don't have to be a build your own character
[12:09 AM] fancy: in fact most are not
[12:09 AM] fancy: it's a shitty rpg sure
[12:09 AM] fancy: byproduct of being shitty game
[12:09 AM] fancy: but still rpg
[12:10 AM] fancy: most jrpgs are in fact 0 player control over the personality of the characters(edited)
[12:18 AM] A Random Badger: Ah but even jrpgs allow the player to build upon that character and choose drastically differing desicions that can impact the game a wider scale. That is most often the minimum requirement to be considered an rpg otherwise we could call any game where you have to play a specific character that isn't you, say call of duty or that one game I can't remember with the guy that climbs and stuff kinda like lora croft in her series, an rpg. Fallout 4 has character building on a physical level, as in you literally alter and create the appearance of the character you want to play as, but as far as the game play goes, you do not truly get the freedom most rpgs and even jrpgs allow. Instead you are playing Bethesdas character with w.e appearance you want him or her to be in their linear story line where the only decision you get to really choose is what faction to join and maybe decide the fate of a few npcs. That's it though. You do not create your own story, you do not get to shape and model your character on a mental level. You cannot be evil or bad in any sense unless you simply don't want to play the story line and you just wanna be the lone raider. Fallout 4 is much more similar in comparison to tomb raider and that other game with cool guy that I never played but is really popular than it is to whatever jrpg or modern rpg you could name.
[12:18 AM] fancy: is the witcher an rpg
[12:20 AM] A Random Badger: Uh dunno never really played the game much, at least I didn't really get to parts that included decesion making
[12:20 AM] fancy: well
[12:20 AM] fancy: it is
[12:20 AM] fancy: lol
[12:20 AM] fancy: but like
[12:20 AM] fancy: you don't get that much control over his actual "mental" progression
[12:20 AM] fancy: you're playing a story
[12:20 AM] fancy: I see it as teh same in fallout 4
[12:20 AM] fancy: the story might be shit sure
[12:21 AM] fancy: also most jrpg's you get very little freedom to do anything to the characters
[12:21 AM] fancy: it's basically all predefined
[12:21 AM] fancy: esp in things like FF
[12:21 AM] fancy: even in mass effect the endings are all roughly the same
[12:22 AM] fancy: and I think that's considered an rpg
[12:23 AM] A Random Badger: Yes tho I and I think most people would not consider them rpgs. Most traditional rpgs are the isometric ones anymore
[12:23 AM] fancy: like any way you're trying to disqualify fallout disqualifies a lot of other games
[12:23 AM] fancy: I don't think most people consider fallout 4 to be not an rpg
[12:23 AM] A Random Badger: I'd beg to differ because there been a pot of outrage over it since it's release
[12:24 AM] A Random Badger: Lot*
[12:24 AM] A Random Badger: Not pot
[12:24 AM] fancy: that's always tainted by confirmation bias
[12:24 AM] fancy: the people who think it's an rpg don't go into outrage lol
[12:24 AM] fancy: just like in r/dota all the people that don't give a shit about streamer drama never say anything about streamer drama
[12:24 AM] fancy: or the people that like a patch don't make shitposts about how bad the patch is
[12:25 AM] A Random Badger: Sure and the same could be said for the flip side of the coin tho
[12:25 AM] fancy: and most of the outrage I heard was just that it was incredibly disappointing
[12:25 AM] fancy: and what
[12:25 AM] A Random Badger: There are some people who disagree but just don't give enough of a shit
[12:25 AM] fancy: yes
[12:26 AM] fancy: but NONE of the people who think it's an rpg
[12:26 AM] fancy: are going to raise a stink
[12:26 AM] fancy: that HEY THIS GAME IS AN RPG
[12:26 AM] fancy: cus
[12:26 AM] fancy: why would they lol
[12:26 AM] fancy: so I think fallout 4 is an rpg
[12:26 AM] fancy: just a bad one
[12:27 AM] fancy: and that position has had the most convincing logic from what I'm reading
[12:29 AM] fancy: like games that aren't rpgs are like
[12:29 AM] fancy: dota
[12:29 AM] fancy: or rocket league
[12:30 AM] fancy: or for example
[12:30 AM] fancy: bioshock
[12:30 AM] fancy: is not an rpg
[12:30 AM] fancy: but I think that fallout 4 has more in common with rpgs than with bioshock-esque games
[12:30 AM] A Random Badger: Ugh nevermind I hate how I can't finish typing an argument before you start on with another point
[12:30 AM] fancy: even if it underperforms
[12:30 AM] fancy: I mean you can keep typing lol
[12:30 AM] fancy: I'm going to keep saying things as I think of them lol
[12:30 AM] fancy: I do have the ability to go backwards and re-visit things
[12:31 AM] fancy: that's like half the beauty of text conversations
[12:31 AM] fancy: which suck in every other dimension
[12:31 AM] A Random Badger: W.e I've wasted too much time anyways, you know I'm very concerned about my time management so I'm cutting off here before I waste more of it
[12:32 AM] fancy: idk in what world talking about interesting things is a waste of time
[12:32 AM] fancy: I swear I live in twilight zone
[12:32 AM] fancy: also for the record
[12:32 AM] fancy: in the same vein as u were kinda put-off by my "maybe" answer
[12:32 AM] fancy: I'm also a little offended by the proclamation that talking about things with me is a waste of time
[12:32 AM] fancy: soooo
[12:32 AM] fancy: just food for thought
[12:35 AM] A Random Badger: because im not a conversationalist, i dont not pesonally enjoy conversation, and when i find myself spending more time on conversation that i could spend doing more meaningful things to me like actually playing a game and enjoying myself or studying or practicing i get depressed and anxious because i feel like i wasted all that time i couldve spent doing those things that i already have limited amount of time to be able to do when i could make conversation on a far less limited time frame
[12:35 AM] fancy: I'm not telling you that you're wrong to think the way you do
[12:35 AM] fancy: but on the topic of
[12:36 AM] fancy: you feeling that people dont' want to spend time with you
[12:36 AM] fancy: and that whole conversation
[12:36 AM] fancy: you have to realize that you have to talk to people about stuff to have a relationship with them
[12:36 AM] fancy: you don't even have to be good at conversation
[12:36 AM] fancy: I'm not "good" at conversation
[12:36 AM] fancy: I just like to talk
[12:36 AM] fancy: about
[12:36 AM] fancy: things
[12:36 AM] fancy: and listen to stories
[12:36 AM] fancy: and hear people's perspectives(edited)
[12:36 AM] fancy: and that's why people liek to talk to me
[12:37 AM] fancy: because I will listen to whatever they want to ramble on about
[12:37 AM] fancy: again, just food for thought
[12:37 AM] fancy: I'm just making aware of what your actions are telling me and what the consequences of them are
[12:38 AM] fancy: you can choose to do what u wish with that information
[12:38 AM] fancy: and there's no "right" or "wrong" thing
[12:38 AM] fancy: people are like functions
[12:38 AM] fancy: u put in x and u get y
[12:38 AM] fancy: put in a, get b
[12:38 AM] fancy: every time
[12:38 AM] fancy: i use math analogy cus u have math boner
[12:38 AM] fancy: or something
[12:38 AM] fancy: xd
[12:41 AM] A Random Badger: it is a paradox for me, either i spend more time talking to people to build relationships that i wont necessarily even be comfortable with because i distrust the intentions of everyone around me while also regretting my decision to talk to people when i could be spending that tie by myself and trying to enjoy myself OR i can spend more time doing things i want to by myself wishing i friends, that i trusted the intentions of, to talk to about things and play similar games with but at least on this flip side of the coin i can at least numb my brain and the pain and enjoy myself in at least a little bit by playing the game i want to because at least i can trust that the intention of game is never to harm me, thus i lean towards this side of the coin
[12:42 AM] fancy: I understand
[12:42 AM] fancy: I have lived through the same paradox
[12:42 AM] fancy: but it's still my responsibility to make u aware of what's going on
[12:43 AM] fancy: I invite you to consider what each person has done specifically to earn your distrust
[12:43 AM] fancy: just as a thought exercise
[12:43 AM] fancy: when u have nothing better to do
[12:44 AM] fancy: it doesn't solve the problem but it helps
[12:44 AM] A Random Badger: id rather not, it'll just prevent me my sleep for tonight and i can assure myself i will find something whether it is logical or just based on anxiey i will not know but it will not matter to my brain and heart
[12:45 AM] fancy: you have to confront things at some point
[12:45 AM] fancy: and I didn't say it has to be tonight
[12:45 AM] fancy: there is lots of time
[1:00 AM] A Random Badger: well lets see and talk about some things then sine i dont really have the time for games anymore and wont be able to sleep anytime soon. starting with you i constantly feel like you really dont give a shit about anything but your own progress in whether dota or w.e which i personally find admirable but not a very good quality for a potential friend, you seem to get irriatble over the flaws of other people and remove yourself from awkward or conflicting situations to avoid the drama regardless of whether someone else's thoughts or emotions actually have a perfectly logical basis which kinda shows that you just dont care. pizza i find to be the same way in several ways altho he tends to be much more forthcoming and "nice" with other people but when conflict does start brewing he is pretty quick to jump and fight at your side seemingly regardless of what is actually going on which sure shows he's loyal to his best friend but also shows he generally just doesnt give a shit about other people because he has his group of friends and his happiness and thats all he has to worry about.
[1:00 AM] A Random Badger: Roszara i still generally find to not really give a shit about many things but herself and her own passions and i still stick by my guns with my statement that she prefers you guys over me since you're better dota players which i personally think is fine, hell it was sure quick of her to decide that from the time she started playing with me to the time she started playing and talking to you guys that instead of me being this gr8 4k offlaner to look up to im just a trash noob who doesnt really know all that much about dota afterall coming from LoL and not having much experience in Dota yet, not to mention the only times she actually wishes to conversate with me is when it seems like she's feeling awefully sympathetic about my flaws and personal issues along with a seemingly fake show of support when good things happen because after all she has found better friends and has her own problems to deal with but i'd imagine its hard for her to just burn a bridge with someone so easily which is why she keeps up with me anyways. i think you 3 are the primary points anyways. ninten might actually be the only one im close to trusting but im not entirely sure about that either but another time
[1:02 AM] fancy: explain why I don't seem to give a shit about other people
[1:02 AM] fancy: in the context of me spending a lot of time in the past couple days/weeks talking to you about your struggles
[1:02 AM] fancy: and sharing mine with you
[1:02 AM] fancy: in hopes that you can see some of where you could relate to what I've been through
[1:03 AM] fancy: and in context of how I'm always trying to explain dota to people, and yes, i get frustrated, but consider that it's usually when the people I'm trying to explain things to are combative
[1:03 AM] fancy: and in context of hope and co.
[1:03 AM] fancy: and in context of my story about ashley and high school
[1:04 AM] A Random Badger: its hard to differentiate between blind sympathy and actual concern, that is my problem with most people
[1:04 AM] A Random Badger: as is my sad experience with msot people it has seemed
[1:04 AM] fancy: do I strike you as a person that says things to say things
[1:04 AM] fancy: rather than saying what I think
[1:05 AM] fancy: discounting, of course, my aggressive exaggeration
[1:05 AM] fancy: I agree it's hard to differentiate sometimes
[1:05 AM] fancy: and I struggled with that a lot in high school
[1:05 AM] fancy: I once told a friend
[1:05 AM] fancy: that if I were to die
[1:05 AM] fancy: I'm not sure anyone would show up because they missed me
[1:06 AM] fancy: and they people would go because they were supposed to
[1:06 AM] A Random Badger: often times i find it difficult specifically with your intentions because it seems to me like most times are just efforts for the satisfaction of winning a debate or arguement
[1:06 AM] fancy: I don't debate to win though
[1:06 AM] fancy: I don't think the things i say align with that position either
[1:06 AM] fancy: I debate to find the truth sure, but the primary reason I debate is because I enjoy it
[1:07 AM] fancy: I enjoy collectively sharing viewpoints
[1:07 AM] fancy: and working towards what is true
[1:07 AM] fancy: that's why i get mad when people devolve into name calling
[1:07 AM] fancy: because if you look at the things I say, I make a very concerted effort to present things using facts and definition and analogies, etc
[1:08 AM] fancy: and I rarely if ever just straight out insult people or just assert that they're wrong
[1:08 AM] fancy: without any backup
[1:08 AM] fancy: that's what people who want to win debates do
[1:08 AM] fancy: I don't care about winning
[1:08 AM] fancy: I care that at the end we're both more right than we were before
[1:08 AM] fancy: but
[1:08 AM] fancy: again I ask,
[1:08 AM] fancy: what am I getting out of trying to help you
[1:08 AM] fancy: when I talk to you about things like this(edited)
[1:09 AM] fancy: rather, what do you think I'm trying to win?
[1:09 AM] fancy: do you think that I'm shallow enough to think that if I talk to you because "I'm supposed to", I get to check something off my list of "was i a good person today"
[1:09 AM] fancy: do I seem like someone who regularly engages in things I don't enjoy and that I don't think have merit
[1:10 AM] fancy: consider hope: I thought she had lots of merit until she revelead things about herself such that I no longer want to talk to her
[1:10 AM] fancy: and now I don't make an effort to include her in my life
[1:10 AM] fancy: same with ashley
[1:10 AM] fancy: and I suppose you could take that down the route of
[1:11 AM] fancy: "oh well fancy's just gonna stick around until I tell him something he doens't like, and then he'll leave"
[1:11 AM] fancy: which, admittedly, perhaps might happen in the future
[1:11 AM] fancy: but I don't think I've presented as a particularly shallow person
[1:11 AM] fancy: and so you'd have to do something like murder my family for me to write you off
[1:12 AM] fancy: I didn't even write ashley off even with how she treated me
[1:12 AM] fancy: the decision for us to not really talk any more, at least the most recent, current one
[1:12 AM] fancy: just happened naturally
[1:12 AM] fancy: friendships wax and wane
[1:13 AM] fancy: but if you put effort into them, they tend to wax more than wane
[1:13 AM] fancy: so if you think I talk to you for any other reason than I value you you as a friend and as a person and I enjoy your company, I invite you to think about the pattern of who I talk to
[1:14 AM] fancy: because I think you'd find that I'm pretty consistent in only talking to people that I think are worth it
[1:18 AM] fancy: to address the other points
[1:21 AM] fancy: do you think I'd get irritable over people I didn't care about
[1:21 AM] fancy: over their flaws?
[1:21 AM] fancy: additionally, pls examples of what you mean
[1:21 AM] fancy: by removing myself from awkward situations
[1:21 AM] fancy: to avoid drama
[1:21 AM] fancy: I'm pretty sure I've said that I love drama before lol
[1:22 AM] fancy: and I don't think I agree with your assertion that I don't consider that other people's emotions have a logical basis(edited)
[1:22 AM] fancy: I believe that, at the very least, I've told you many times that I completely understand where you're coming from and why and how you can feel certain ways about things
[1:23 AM] fancy: also I believe that the phenomenon of pizza defending me is because he agrees with me
[1:23 AM] fancy: there have been many times when he's disagreed with me
[1:23 AM] fancy: and he's been on the other side of the argument against me
[1:23 AM] fancy: he's not taking my side because I'm his friend
[1:23 AM] fancy: he's taking my side because he agrees with me
[1:25 AM] fancy: To address Roszara, which is of limited use because I can understand that little will persuade you otherwise because of underlying factors, which is just how life do. I lived through it with Ashley myself, so I've been there.
[1:25 AM] fancy: Roszara and pizza seldom talk
[1:26 AM] fancy: probably not more often than she does with you(edited)
[1:26 AM] fancy: and even though I'm going to tell you this again,  you're not going to believe me probably
[1:26 AM] fancy: but
[1:26 AM] fancy: like I said about the conversation thing
[1:26 AM] fancy: she talks to me becasue I always respond back
[1:26 AM] fancy: I'm alway shere
[1:26 AM] fancy: I'm always supportive
[1:26 AM] fancy: I always listen to whatever she wants to rant about
[1:27 AM] fancy: even when I don't agree with her
[1:27 AM] fancy: like, yes we talk about dota some because I know a lot about dota
[1:27 AM] fancy: and we share that passion
[1:27 AM] fancy: pizza and I don't even share that passion
[1:27 AM] fancy: Dota is the thing I know the most about in this world
[1:27 AM] fancy: so yeah, naturally we talk about dota some
[1:27 AM] fancy: but we also talk about random shit
[1:28 AM] fancy: Things that I'd be led to believe that you'd consider a waste of time because you dont' want to waste time conversing
[1:28 AM] fancy: we've debated about ai and the differences between men and women, and books we've read
[1:28 AM] fancy: it's a large range of things, and, yeah, strictly speaking, none of it was "practical" or perhaps an efficient use of time
[1:28 AM] fancy: but that's what people do
[1:29 AM] fancy: is they talk about things
[1:29 AM] fancy: I can't comment on what your side looks like
[1:29 AM] fancy: but like
[1:29 AM] fancy: if you're just waiting for her to bring something up and not starting conversations also
[1:29 AM] fancy: she's naturally going to talk to you less
[1:30 AM] fancy: at least that's the way it works usually
[1:30 AM] fancy: I've always had the problem where I feel like I'm always the one starting conversations
[1:30 AM] fancy: or asking people to do things
[1:30 AM] fancy: and I've always felt like if I didn't ask, people would forget that I was around
[1:30 AM] fancy: and the older I get the more I realize that's an unfounded belief
[1:31 AM] fancy: because I was going for people that didn't really have anything in common with me in the first place
[1:31 AM] fancy: once I settled down and stopped worrying so much, I found people I had common interests with
[1:32 AM] fancy: friendship isn't a competition
[1:32 AM] fancy: I don't rank all my friends
[1:32 AM] fancy: yeah some I'm closer to than others
[1:32 AM] fancy: I'm closer to pizza than to you
[1:32 AM] fancy: I'm closer to you than to ninten
[1:32 AM] fancy: but that's okay
[1:33 AM] fancy: friendship is about mutual support between people that enjoy each other's company at some point
[1:33 AM] fancy: like
[1:33 AM] fancy: I have a lot of dota friends now
[1:33 AM] fancy: that I would never talk to outside of dota
[1:33 AM] fancy: they're just friends I play dota with
[1:33 AM] fancy: I have work friends that I'm friends with because of work
[1:33 AM] fancy: do I value one of those groups more than the other? no
[1:33 AM] fancy: they're just different
[1:33 AM] fancy: but they're all friends
[1:33 AM] fancy: they're not close friends, but they're friends
[1:35 AM] fancy: I know it's hard, but you should try to not see it as "oh well x has people that they're better friends with than they are with me and that makes me inferior"
[1:36 AM] fancy: because that's perverting something good
[1:36 AM] fancy: and i've been there
[1:36 AM] fancy: so I know how easy it is to twist good things into bad things
[1:36 AM] fancy: and it's hard to explain how to stop doing that
[1:36 AM] fancy: other than as
[1:36 AM] fancy: you have to get to a point where you don't want to see the bad in thigns
[1:36 AM] fancy: it's liek with andrew: he's constantly looking for a reason to fight and have conflict lately
[1:36 AM] fancy: and I'm not sure why
[1:37 AM] fancy: but it's making him unhappy
[1:37 AM] fancy: idk how much you've been paying attention to my discord chat
[1:37 AM] fancy: but if you have, hopefully that would help you see what it's like(edited)
[1:43 AM] A Random Badger: I'm too tired to say what I wanted anyways. Maybe I won't wake up this time. At least I have my math to assure me that will always be a possibility. And yea I probably won't bother continuing with this tomorrow anyways in hopes of being able to enjoy myself somehow.
[1:44 AM] A Random Badger: Which I doubt
[1:45 AM] fancy: I'm sorry I confront you with things you don't seem to like
[1:46 AM] A Random Badger: It's fine. I'd like to think that you mean well but yanno(edited)
[1:47 AM] A Random Badger: All I know is I don't believe in change and I really don't think there anything that can change me
[1:48 AM] fancy: And what I know is that I said the same thing
[1:48 AM] fancy: and when I was told by other people that they'd said the same thing
[1:48 AM] fancy: I believed I was right
[1:48 AM] fancy: and they didn't know what they were talking about
[1:48 AM] fancy: People change tho, it's happened
[1:48 AM] fancy: that's all I can tell you
[1:49 AM] A Random Badger: Yea well let's hope I get to have an ashley situation then which is doubtful
[1:49 AM] fancy: Ashley was definitely bad for me
[1:49 AM] fancy: I hope you don't
[1:49 AM] fancy: I would have been better off not going through that
[1:50 AM] fancy: I learned stuff from it but I also suffered
[1:50 AM] fancy: greatly
[1:51 AM] fancy: Life has a way of surprising you though(edited)
[1:51 AM] A Random Badger: I think it's surprised me enough, it's time for life to gtfo
[1:51 AM] fancy: nah
[1:51 AM] fancy: it gets better
[1:52 AM] fancy: always ups and downs
[1:53 AM] A Random Badger: Doubtfully so. Either way I get to sit and wait more as time drags on. Rather I was just on enough meds to make me a zombie at this point tho
[1:54 AM] fancy: I've been there
[1:54 AM] A Random Badger: Sure. I lost enough time and sleep. I'm going to bed before I get to suffer more tomorrow
[1:55 AM] fancy: u still sound like me lol
[1:55 AM] fancy: bless dude
[1:55 AM] fancy: bless
[1:43 PM] A Random Badger: I mean tbh I also have issues with whether or not I view myself as a good friend to others and if I attract the wrong type of friends. I generally also hate the way I'm treated as based off the way I act. For example I act like a joker because it's the only thing I'm good for yet I hate being recognized and treated as such and never taken seriously even tho I think I'm somewhat of an intellectual person but I'm not confident enough in my intellectual ability to put that forth to people especially in first impressions not to mention it seems like people get more friends and attention for being a joker than being an intellectual. In line with that I generally hate being treated like I'm stupid or I'm a child and it feels that way most often when playing dota with you and pizza most often instead of just lending helpful advise in a non construed way and then it stresses me out which results in me acting like a joker and being treated even more poorly but I've already gone into that before. Anyways there's a little more explanation for you ig while I'm sitting here at work early again
[1:45 PM] fancy: well
[1:45 PM] fancy: couple things
[1:46 PM] fancy: overall, one of the hardest things is getting to a place where you're happy with who you are personally
[1:46 PM] fancy: and secure enough to not care what other people think
[1:46 PM] fancy: and to just do things you want to do
[1:46 PM] fancy: and be the way you want
[1:46 PM] fancy: and accepting that some people won't like that
[1:47 PM] fancy: learning that and learning to forive yourself are the two hardest things to learn imo
[1:47 PM] fancy: but to continue
[1:48 PM] fancy: if you want a certain type of friend than you have to treat them how you'd like them to treat you(edited)
[1:48 PM] fancy: if all you want is shallow memer dota friends
[1:48 PM] fancy: that's easy
[1:48 PM] fancy: but that's not as satisfying as close friends
[1:48 PM] fancy: and to have close friends you have to open up to people and vulnerable
[1:49 PM] fancy: and they'll open up back
[1:49 PM] fancy: and eventually it becomes something more solid and less ephemeral than nerds you play dota with
[1:49 PM] fancy: if I stopped playing dota I'd never talk to most of the people in taw again
[1:49 PM] fancy: but they're still "friends" now
[1:50 PM] fancy: but I'd still talk to Andrew and Julian and you and roszara
[1:50 PM] fancy: etc
[1:50 PM] fancy: and even if I quit all video games totally I know I'd at least still talk to pizza, and perhaps the rest of you guys too idk
[1:50 PM] fancy: but it's like I said yesterday
[1:50 PM] fancy: if you want friends you have to be a friend back
[1:51 PM] fancy: it's a two way street
[1:51 PM] fancy: you can't always respond with "oh whatever I'm too tired to respond" when people put a lot of effort into a conversation
[1:51 PM] fancy: amongst other things
[1:51 PM] fancy: etc
[1:51 PM] fancy: another thing
[1:51 PM] fancy: you are in complete control of how you present yourself
[1:52 PM] fancy: yes, if you act like a child, you will annoy me
[1:52 PM] fancy: and I will treat you like a child
[1:52 PM] fancy: that's the same for everyone I know
[1:52 PM] fancy: if you want to be taken seriously, present seriously
[1:52 PM] fancy: who cares if you're wrong about things sometimes
[1:52 PM] fancy: I'm wrong all the time
[1:52 PM] fancy: but it's okay
[1:52 PM] fancy: you don't learn by being right
[1:53 PM] fancy: no one said you have to be at least x smart to talk about smart things
[1:53 PM] fancy: you just have to have an open mind and a willingness to engage people
[1:53 PM] fancy: if you shut down every attempt to talk about real things, people will stop engaging you about real things
[1:53 PM] fancy: or even, never start
[1:53 PM] fancy: yanno?
[1:54 PM] fancy: and yeah it's kinda rough to put yourself out there
[1:54 PM] fancy: because it is scary
[1:54 PM] fancy: and you can get hurt
[1:54 PM] fancy: but you don't win dota games by always playing super safe and turrtling
[1:54 PM] fancy: at some point you have to leave your base to win the game
[1:55 PM] A Random Badger: Eh maybe but it's a but late now to make "new" impressions with people
[1:55 PM] A Random Badger: Bit*
[1:55 PM] fancy: you can change who you are to them
[1:55 PM] fancy: it'll take some time but
[1:55 PM] fancy: who cares
[1:55 PM] fancy: I used to be sad depressed meme
[1:55 PM] fancy: now I'm not
[1:55 PM] fancy: people change
[1:56 PM] fancy: it's never too late
[1:56 PM] fancy: unless ur ded
[1:56 PM] fancy: then it's too late
[1:56 PM] fancy: however
[1:56 PM] fancy: comma
[1:56 PM] fancy: you're not dead
[1:57 PM] A Random Badger: Yea ig but still ain't gonna be able to really put effort into anything until I finally move in a few weeks so maybe I just take a break until then but idk
[1:57 PM] fancy: what do you mean
[1:57 PM] fancy: like
[1:57 PM] fancy: just be more serious every time there's an interaction
[1:57 PM] fancy: there's no pressure
[1:57 PM] fancy: like
[1:57 PM] fancy: you're looking at extremes
[1:58 PM] fancy: "either I devote myself fully to this or I dodge it altogether"
[1:58 PM] fancy: but that's not how it works
[1:58 PM] fancy: most things in life are built one step at a time
[1:59 PM] A Random Badger: Ig but I still wanna be able to use my limited time wisely towards being able to relax and play a game
[1:59 PM] A Random Badger: And rebranding myself is gonna be a really stressful experience I can imagine
[1:59 PM] fancy: that doesn't preclude being serious if there's an interaction lol
[1:59 PM] fancy: and it's really not
[1:59 PM] fancy: you kinda just start being different
[1:59 PM] fancy: people aren't gonna like
[2:00 PM] fancy: be combative about it
[2:00 PM] fancy: and if they are u say fuck off lol
[2:00 PM] fancy: cus they're not good friends anyway
[2:00 PM] fancy: friends aren't here to impede your progress
[2:00 PM] fancy: don't see it as a project
[2:00 PM] fancy: just see it as you're just who you are
[2:00 PM] fancy: you don't have to prove anything to anyone
[2:02 PM] A Random Badger: Ig I start work now that and am at 20% battery so cya
[2:03 PM] fancy: bless

[10:16 PM] fancy: idk
[10:16 PM] fancy: like I can understand the sentiment
[10:17 PM] fancy: but at the same time
