6:31 AM] tyler: hi
[6:32 AM] tyler: i wanted to apologize for being an ignorant cunt sometimes
[6:32 AM] tyler: ive reflected on myself
[6:32 AM] tyler: and ive realized i just dont understand things sometimes and i
[6:32 AM] tyler: talk before i think
[6:32 AM] tyler: i guess its just a flaw of mine
[6:33 AM] tyler: i know this is a half assed apology but
[6:33 AM] tyler: i wanted to make it clear that i dont intend on being that way
[6:33 AM] tyler: i was thinking about the old times
[6:33 AM] tyler: when we got along more
[6:34 AM] tyler: its immature of me to react the way i do sometimes with you and nikki
[6:34 AM] tyler: but its just me being overprotective i assume
[6:35 AM] tyler: ive known nikki for ages and am not really used to her having friends other than me
[6:35 AM] tyler: its no excuse, but im sure you can understand my point of view
[6:35 AM] tyler: i should be happy for her, yet i act selfish and childish
[6:36 AM] tyler: i dont know where im going with this, but i just wanted to get those things off my chest and give you insight on my perspective
[6:36 AM] tyler: you dont have to like me and i dont expect you to
[6:36 AM] tyler: you dont have to get along with me or tolerate how i act
[6:37 AM] tyler: but i just wanted to inform you that i am aware that im not the best of people to be around at times and i do make mistakes that i reflect on and regret
[6:37 AM] tyler: i end up embarrassing myself and looking like a fool
[6:39 AM] tyler: nikki is one of my only genuine friends that's always been there for me and she means more than so much to me
[6:39 AM] tyler: its only natural to get jealous and overreact
[6:39 AM] tyler: but it doesnt make it right
[6:40 AM] tyler: so take that how you will, i know you dont hate me or anything, but i just wish we got along better
[6:41 AM] tyler: i'll try to resolve my issues and work towards bettering myself, but i do have a lot on my plate and its just frustrating sometimes
[6:42 AM] tyler: but you're one of nikkis good friends now so i want to try and be friends with you again as well
[6:43 AM] fancy: I appreciate you reaching out
[6:43 AM] fancy: I can empathize with you a bit, I imagine, it's not really that long ago that I was dealing with the same sort of things
[6:44 AM] fancy: obviously not exactly the same
[6:44 AM] fancy: but I guess one of the most disappointing things, for me at least, was that
[6:44 AM] fancy: as I'm sure you remember
[6:44 AM] fancy: I used to spend a lot of time talking with you and helping you figure out how to deal with people
[6:44 AM] fancy: or at least trying to
[6:45 AM] fancy: because it didn't sound like you had a lot of people available to really talk with you about stuff like that
[6:45 AM] fancy: and it's hard
[6:45 AM] fancy: it's hard to be growing up and learning to deal with situations and people that don't always act in ways we'd prefer, etc etc
[6:45 AM] fancy: life is hard
[6:45 AM] fancy: straightforward
[6:45 AM] fancy: but hard
[6:45 AM] fancy: but then after a while
[6:46 AM] fancy: we kinda stopped talking so much
[6:46 AM] fancy: which isn't that big a deal on its own, people go different ways all the time
[6:46 AM] fancy: but then like, when Nikki and I started playing dota and I got reintroduced to this group of people again
[6:47 AM] fancy: you kinda would say a lot of really shitty things about me
[6:47 AM] fancy: for no real reason
[6:47 AM] fancy: and I don't know why
[6:47 AM] tyler: I think its just because of nikki and being defensive
[6:47 AM] tyler: probably
[6:47 AM] fancy: like all I ever did was try to be helpful and what I got was a lot of just... really venomous stuff
[6:47 AM] tyler: Also
[6:48 AM] tyler: not as an excuse but
[6:48 AM] tyler: a lot of people like to target me
[6:48 AM] tyler: always
[6:48 AM] tyler: over anyone else
[6:48 AM] tyler: so its probably the bullying effect
[6:48 AM] tyler: where the bullied people bully others to make them feel better
[6:48 AM] fancy: I can understand that some
[6:48 AM] fancy: but you also should probably understand that
[6:49 AM] tyler: its not right
[6:49 AM] fancy: you kinda put yourself out there a lot
[6:49 AM] tyler: i do
[6:49 AM] fancy: you're very... stream of consciousness
[6:49 AM] tyler: thats why i hate being me sometimes
[6:49 AM] fancy: and if you talk the most you will get the most attention, good and bad
[6:49 AM] tyler: because i cant help it
[6:49 AM] fancy: sure you can
[6:49 AM] fancy: it just takes work and discipline
[6:49 AM] fancy: like learning to do anythign else in life
[6:49 AM] tyler: i dont have any discipline online
[6:49 AM] tyler: all my discipline is irl
[6:50 AM] fancy: you may not, but that doesn't mean you couldn't have it if you wanted it
[6:50 AM] tyler: i kinda just act like a babboon
[6:50 AM] tyler: online
[6:50 AM] fancy: yeah I noticed lol
[6:50 AM] tyler: but
[6:50 AM] tyler: i enjoy it
[6:50 AM] tyler: because in real like
[6:50 AM] tyler: life
[6:50 AM] tyler: im very straight forward
[6:50 AM] tyler: and type A
