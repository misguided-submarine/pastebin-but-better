 [10:01 PM] fancy: I just woke up
[10:01 PM] fancy: and I had
[10:01 PM] fancy: the fucking strangest fucking nightmare
[10:01 PM] fancy: and it was pretty fucking bad
[10:01 PM] fancy: but it's so strange I don't even
[10:02 PM] fancy: like omg
[10:03 PM] fancy: for some reason
[10:03 PM] fancy: like
[10:03 PM] fancy: when I was 7
[10:03 PM] fancy: or something
[10:03 PM] fancy: I wrote on a notebook that I didn't like some lady because she was mean to me
[10:04 PM] fancy: and this was apparently the reason
[10:04 PM] fancy: for my parents to decide that
[10:04 PM] fancy: now I needed to be punished for it
[10:04 PM] fancy: so they like shaved most of my hair while I was asleep
[10:05 PM] fancy: except I would sometimes sorta wake up during it
[10:05 PM] fancy: and be like hmm something is strange
[10:05 PM] fancy: but then I would be like
[10:05 PM] fancy: oh it's just
[10:05 PM] fancy: the dog I was sleeping next too
[10:06 PM] fancy: has been taken away and replaced with a new one
[10:06 PM] fancy: and I couldn't fucking figure out why that would happen but I was super sleepy so I kinda would just phase back into sleep
[10:07 PM] fancy: but it was a really unnerving feeling
[10:07 PM] fancy: and then at some point I got really fucking cold
[10:07 PM] fancy: while I was sleeping in my dream
[10:07 PM] fancy: that I kinda woke up
[10:07 PM] fancy: and realized what was happening
[10:07 PM] fancy: and I was like
[10:08 PM] fancy: so fucking confused and really upset
[10:08 PM] fancy: and like "why would anyone do this"
[10:08 PM] saucy: ummmm
[10:08 PM] saucy: wtf lol
[10:08 PM] saucy: that was your dream?
[10:08 PM] fancy: IM NOT DONE EVEN
[10:08 PM] fancy: YES
[10:08 PM] fancy: IT GETS WEIRDER(edited)
[10:08 PM] fancy: so as I'm like
[10:09 PM] fancy: trying to come to terms with my parents being fucking nuts
[10:09 PM] fancy: they hit me with that explanation
[10:09 PM] fancy: except in fewer details
[10:09 PM] fancy: they're like one time you wrote etc etc
[10:09 PM] fancy: and they used her name
[10:09 PM] fancy: and I remember having a fucking difficult time remembering who the fuck it was
[10:10 PM] fancy: and when I finally realized I realized it was when I was fucking SEVEN
[10:10 PM] fancy: and I'm like what the fuck
[10:10 PM] fancy: and then like
[10:10 PM] fancy: so you know the feeling you get
[10:10 PM] fancy: like a sinking realization
[10:10 PM] fancy: I got that feeling but like times 100
[10:10 PM] fancy: AND FOR SOME REASON
[10:11 PM] fancy: I figured that this was so bad
[10:11 PM] fancy: and I couldn't make any fucking sense of it
[10:11 PM] fancy: that the answer was to go kill myself
[10:11 PM] fancy: and I told my parents this
[10:11 PM] fancy: and their answer was fucking
[10:11 PM] fancy: like as I started to say like
[10:12 PM] fancy: how they're fucking nuts and this makes no sense, i was seven etc.
[10:12 PM] fancy: when I was just about to get to the part where I'm like
[10:12 PM] fancy: I'm going to go kill myself
[10:12 PM] fancy: my mom interrupts
[10:12 PM] fancy: and is like
[10:12 PM] fancy: you know we know someone else like this
[10:13 PM] fancy: we went on a walk today
[10:13 PM] fancy: and we met so-and-so (idr the name)
[10:13 PM] fancy: she went on a walk.
[10:13 PM] fancy: she never came back.
[10:13 PM] fancy: don't you come back either
[10:14 PM] fancy: and like cus dreams I knew that she was basically telling me to kill myself
[10:14 PM] fancy: because apparently that's the proper punishment for saying some one is mean and you don't like them when you're SEVEN
[10:15 PM] fancy: and so I'm like half speechless
[10:15 PM] fancy: but I open the door anyone and like
[10:15 PM] fancy: I'm going to go kill myself
[10:15 PM] fancy: and she says
[10:15 PM] fancy: are you really or are you gonna call later and ask how to find your way back home
[10:15 PM] fancy: and I'm like wtf I'm really gonna do it
[10:15 PM] fancy: and then she starts laughing
[10:16 PM] fancy: and then my dad gets this like
[10:16 PM] fancy: really weird look and starts walking
[10:16 PM] fancy: and then just fucking yells "then DIE" at the top of his lungs and flings a fucking axe at me
[10:17 PM] fancy: and then I was kinda like in slo mo time as it's flying
[10:17 PM] fancy: as I'm imagining like
[10:17 PM] fancy: what it would feel like if the axe hit me
[10:17 PM] fancy: or
[10:17 PM] fancy: how any of this makes fucking sense
[10:17 PM] fancy: or what the hell is going on
[10:17 PM] fancy: etc
[10:17 PM] fancy: and then I wake up
[10:18 PM] fancy: but man the overall just feeling of pure terror and uneaskness I had during that whole dream are so indescribable
[10:18 PM] fancy: I don't even know dude
[10:19 PM] saucy: what in the fuck
[10:19 PM] saucy: i know it was like a nightmare for you
[10:19 PM] saucy: but as i am reading this
[10:19 PM] saucy: i couldn't help but laugh
[10:19 PM] fancy: IT SOUNDS REALLY FUNNY RIGHT
[10:19 PM] fancy: but like
[10:19 PM] saucy: because nothing makes fucking sense
[10:19 PM] fancy: during the entire fucking thing
[10:19 PM] fancy: I just
[10:19 PM] fancy: inexplicably am terrified
[10:19 PM] fancy: every step of the way
[10:19 PM] saucy: like the part where your dad just throws an axe
[10:19 PM] saucy: this is a really weird dream
[10:19 PM] fancy: and I had permanent sinking feeling in my stomach that just kept getting worse
[10:20 PM] fancy: and realizing I was actually going to die and my life was over
[10:20 PM] fancy: man what the fuck even
[10:20 PM] fancy: like
[10:20 PM] fancy: why were my parents so evil suddenly
[10:20 PM] fancy: and why was my dreams portrayal of pure evil fucking
[10:20 PM] fancy: TO SHAVE MY HEAD
[10:21 PM] fancy: and then expect me to die
[10:21 PM] fancy: like what
[10:21 PM] saucy: because you're beautiful
[10:21 PM] fancy: and the dog thing
[10:21 PM] fancy: like what even
[10:21 PM] fancy: why was there a dog
[10:21 PM] fancy: I don't own a dog
[10:21 PM] fancy: I've never owned a dog
[10:21 PM] fancy: why would I be sleeping with a dog
[10:21 PM] fancy: and there was some detail I can't really remember about how
[10:22 PM] fancy: I realized my parents were replacing the dog after it got "used up"
[10:22 PM] fancy: in an effort to keep me asleep during this
[10:22 PM] fancy: except I was like hmm I guess they didn't realize the reason the first dog kept me sleepy was
[10:22 PM] fancy: he was really fucking high on weed
[10:22 PM] fancy: and I was getting high off his breath
[10:22 PM] saucy: ummm
[10:22 PM] saucy: wat
[10:22 PM] fancy: which made me sleepy
[10:23 PM] fancy: but when they replaced it then that didn't work any more
[10:23 PM] fancy: cus the new dogs weren't getting high
[10:23 PM] fancy: I mean weren't high
[10:23 PM] fancy: YEAH IDK
[10:23 PM] fancy: that's not even how that works
[10:23 PM] fancy: I think
[10:23 PM] fancy: I need an adult
[10:23 PM] fancy: lol
[10:24 PM] saucy: what the fuck
[10:24 PM] saucy: omg lol
[10:24 PM] saucy: this really
[10:24 PM] saucy: makes no sense
[10:24 PM] saucy: at all
[10:24 PM] saucy: and it's so random
[10:24 PM] saucy: i can't stop
[10:24 PM] saucy: laughing
[10:25 PM] fancy: I KNOW
[10:25 PM] fancy: I have issues
