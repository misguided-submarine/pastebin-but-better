[5:55 PM] A Random Badger: but i think theres something to be desired about learning more complex things and being able to solve those a lot faster than you would've when you first started learning it and discovering the deeper complexities to something the more you got into it making it an endless learning experience almost
[5:55 PM] A Random Badger: imo
[5:55 PM] fancy: yeah sure learning is good
[5:55 PM] fancy: but I don't really find any attraction to solvable problems
[5:56 PM] A Random Badger: ig it depends on the level of difficulty
[5:56 PM] A Random Badger: pesonally when i was in high school
[5:57 PM] A Random Badger: me and my math teacher and some other math pals would literally just hang out trying to figure out new problems or at least more complex variations of a particular problem and it was really rewarding to solve them and it was enjoyable because it was new and challenging compared to something that is mroe like not so much difficult as time consuming to solve
[5:58 PM] A Random Badger: personally i just really enjoy learning and participating in things that have those deeper complexities
[5:58 PM] fancy: well yeah it's mildly rewarding to solve problems
[5:58 PM] fancy: but it wears off
[5:58 PM] A Random Badger: sure if you're solving the same problems over and over
[5:58 PM] fancy: nah
[5:58 PM] A Random Badger: or same type at least
[5:59 PM] fancy: eventually most problems boil down to the same things
[5:59 PM] fancy: at least of that type
[5:59 PM] fancy: that's why I like talking about social and philosophical things
[5:59 PM] fancy: because there really isn't an answer we can reasonably find during our lifespan
[5:59 PM] A Random Badger: yea i dont really care about social or philosophical things frankly
[6:00 PM] A Random Badger: i like problem solving
[6:00 PM] fancy: I guess I was like that once
[6:00 PM] A Random Badger: strategizing
[6:00 PM] A Random Badger: learning
[6:00 PM] fancy: unfortunately social and philosophical issues are more or less what life is about
[6:00 PM] A Random Badger: etc
[6:00 PM] fancy: lol
[6:00 PM] A Random Badger: eh
[6:00 PM] fancy: that's amusing
[6:01 PM] A Random Badger: what is
[6:01 PM] fancy: that you say you like learning
[6:02 PM] A Random Badger: uh sure i only like learning specific things which mostly excludes life
[6:02 PM] fancy: kinda
[6:02 PM] fancy: odd
[6:02 PM] fancy: imo
[6:03 PM] fancy: pretty odd even
[6:03 PM] fancy: eyyyyyy
[6:05 PM] A Random Badger: idc about life, other peoples lives, how life works, how people interact, stuff like that. it doesnt interest me. i rather just sit down and think about math and strategy and Go and the complexities of the universe and the sciences. idc about anything uh, human related unless its learning about ancient human history which i do find very interesting
[6:05 PM] fancy: that's a really youthful perspective I think
[6:06 PM] A Random Badger: maybe but theres plenty of older scholars who just dont give a shit about life
[6:06 PM] fancy: I'd say they still have a pretty youthfully nihilistic outlook
[6:07 PM] A Random Badger: maybe but what makes the desire to understand life any more mature
[6:07 PM] fancy: for me the way I see it
[6:08 PM] fancy: chasing factoids and data and shit as an end in itself
[6:08 PM] fancy: I think is generally fairly unfulfilling
[6:08 PM] fancy: I'm sure some people get their kicks from it and that's all they need
[6:08 PM] fancy: but I think in general people need more than that as their purpose to exist
[6:09 PM] A Random Badger: why do i need a purpose to exist tho if i may interject
[6:09 PM] fancy: and the reason I'd prefer things that don't have answers is that they are a huge stepping stone to engaging in conversation
[6:09 PM] fancy: uh because it's generally recognized that if you feel you have no purpose you end up being a miserable wretch
[6:09 PM] fancy: and no one likes that
[6:09 PM] fancy: anyway
[6:10 PM] fancy: and engaging in conversation is one of the best if not the best ways to have social interactions
[6:10 PM] fancy: and learn about people and form bonds
[6:10 PM] fancy: and I think that's far more fulfilling overall
[6:13 PM] fancy: It's really hard to start conversations about things that have been solved
[6:13 PM] fancy: or that are solvable
[6:13 PM] fancy: because the conversation invariably doesn't really go anywhere more than that
[6:20 PM] A Random Badger: eh i cant figure out how to explain what i want in a reasonable amount of time in a way that you could understand
[6:23 PM] fancy: and as we all know the saying goes "if you don't think you can succeed, never even try"
[6:23 PM] fancy: smh
[6:23 PM] fancy: one day you'll come around
[6:23 PM] fancy: maybe
[6:23 PM] fancy: hopefully
[6:23 PM] A Random Badger: well i was trying and then it started getting to the point it was way too long, and i couldnt figure out a way to condense and simplify it
[6:24 PM] A Random Badger: and i wasnt even able to figure out how to tie it together
[6:24 PM] A Random Badger: so oh well ig
[6:24 PM] A Random Badger: i was trying to get into string theory ig
[6:24 PM] A Random Badger: theres a taste of it
[6:24 PM] A Random Badger: you can figure out the rest
[6:24 PM] A Random Badger: xd
[6:25 PM] fancy: I mean
[6:25 PM] fancy: no I can't figure it out
[6:25 PM] fancy: I have no idea what you're thinking cus you didn't give me anything
[6:27 PM] fancy: because you tend to fundamentally shy away from sharing what you think about things
[6:27 PM] fancy: so
[6:27 PM] fancy: no
[6:27 PM] fancy: I can't figure it out lol
[6:28 PM] fancy: length isn't a problem if you just insert arbitrary breaking points of whitespace so I can read it without getting lost
[6:28 PM] fancy: if you say things I don't understand I ask what you mean
[6:28 PM] fancy: I think that's pretty consistently demonstrable
[6:35 PM] A Random Badger: Hmmm
[6:35 PM] A Random Badger: How much do you know about strong theory
[6:36 PM] A Random Badger: String
[6:36 PM] A Random Badger: Do you understand its concept of the existence of 11 dimensions
[6:38 PM] fancy: from what I understand it's basically cyclical compounding
[6:39 PM] fancy: point line plane vector repeat
[6:39 PM] fancy: or something like that
[6:41 PM] A Random Badger: okay do you understand the experimentation with photons
[6:41 PM] fancy: that's a very vague question
[6:41 PM] A Random Badger: the particular experimentaion im referring to involves the launching of photons to a very specific point in space
[6:42 PM] A Random Badger: they could only go to that one particular spot
[6:42 PM] A Random Badger: but sometimes
[6:42 PM] A Random Badger: they would just
[6:42 PM] A Random Badger: vanish
[6:42 PM] A Random Badger: literally just disappear
[6:43 PM] A Random Badger: so the belief was and is through further studies that its not simply disappearing, its traveling to point in space within a different dimension
[6:43 PM] A Random Badger: we as 3 dimensional entities can never experience things outside of our dimension
[6:44 PM] A Random Badger: how we percieve things is based purly on our 3 dimensions
[6:44 PM] A Random Badger: we can occasionally witness the shadow of soemthing from a high dimension much like the shadow of us on a 2 dimensional surface
[6:44 PM] A Random Badger: so to speak
[6:45 PM] A Random Badger: im sure you've seen thigns about the tesseract
[6:45 PM] A Random Badger: a 4 dimensional cube
[6:45 PM] A Random Badger: we could never actually see it but we can imagine its shadow on our 3 dimensional world much like how a cube would cast its shadow on a 2 dimensional plane
[6:46 PM] fancy: yeah the theory is that an entity that exists in a certain dimension can only fully observe things in lower dimensions
[6:46 PM] fancy: or something like that
[6:46 PM] A Random Badger: yea its and lower
[6:46 PM] fancy: well not its own right
[6:46 PM] fancy: not fully
[6:46 PM] A Random Badger: yea fair enough
[6:47 PM] fancy: because isn't the idea that we exist in the 4th dimension but we can't really see the entire 4th dimension at once
[6:47 PM] A Random Badger: idk about that
[6:47 PM] fancy: well
[6:47 PM] fancy: to illustrate
[6:47 PM] fancy: imagine you're a point on a line
[6:47 PM] A Random Badger: technically its believed that the universe is comprised of 11 dimensions
[6:47 PM] fancy: composed btw
[6:47 PM] A Random Badger: yes
[6:47 PM] A Random Badger: sorry
[6:47 PM] A Random Badger: so technically we would be existing in 11 dimensions
[6:48 PM] A Random Badger: i suppose
[6:48 PM] A Random Badger: but only as 3 dimensional entities
[6:48 PM] fancy: but if you're a point on a line you technically could be said to exist in the first dimension but
[6:48 PM] fancy: everything you could see
[6:48 PM] fancy: and observe
[6:48 PM] fancy: would look 0-dimensional
[6:48 PM] fancy: aka more points
[6:48 PM] fancy: and if you're a line, you exist in 2 dimensions but can only observe things as lines
[6:48 PM] fancy: or something like that
[6:48 PM] fancy: so on and so forth
[6:49 PM] A Random Badger: yes
[6:49 PM] fancy: like that book flatland
[6:49 PM] A Random Badger: yes
[6:49 PM] A Random Badger: by that professor
[6:49 PM] A Random Badger: he has a video on it too
[6:49 PM] A Random Badger: discussing flatland and the tesseract
[6:49 PM] A Random Badger: and etc
[6:49 PM] fancy: yea
[6:49 PM] A Random Badger: really interesting
[6:49 PM] A Random Badger: anyways
[6:49 PM] fancy: and it would be really hard for us to imagine our own dimension or higher order ones
[6:49 PM] fancy: if not inpossible
[6:50 PM] A Random Badger: we can occasionally witness a shadow
[6:50 PM] A Random Badger: but thats it
[6:50 PM] A Random Badger: but even then we wouldnt really
[6:50 PM] A Random Badger: know it
[6:50 PM] A Random Badger: we could never know its a shadow of something from a high dimension
[6:50 PM] A Random Badger: because thats just the restriction
[6:50 PM] A Random Badger: anyways
[6:50 PM] A Random Badger: you understand it
[6:50 PM] A Random Badger: good
[6:50 PM] A Random Badger: so
[6:51 PM] A Random Badger: another thing i wanna tie into this is the fact that we know energy can never
[6:51 PM] A Random Badger: cease
[6:51 PM] A Random Badger: it can uh
[6:51 PM] A Random Badger: turn into a different form of energy
[6:51 PM] A Random Badger: but it never just
[6:51 PM] A Random Badger: ceases to exist
[6:51 PM] A Random Badger: conservation of energy
[6:51 PM] A Random Badger: we know this as fact
[6:51 PM] A Random Badger: yes
[6:51 PM] A Random Badger: ?
[6:51 PM] fancy: yeah cus a 4d shadow would be 3d
[6:51 PM] fancy: makes sense
[6:51 PM] fancy: and uhh
[6:51 PM] fancy: catching up one sec
[6:51 PM] A Random Badger: np
[6:52 PM] fancy: uh yeah generally as far as we can possibly tell so far energy doesn't get created or destroyed
[6:52 PM] fancy: at least as we know it
[6:52 PM] A Random Badger: yes
[6:52 PM] A Random Badger: okay
[6:52 PM] A Random Badger: a new thing i want to introduce to you that you may not have heard of
[6:52 PM] A Random Badger: is we believe there is an average weight of the soul
[6:53 PM] A Random Badger: and the soul is more or less just the energy force of our entity
[6:53 PM] A Random Badger: i think its like
[6:53 PM] A Random Badger: 23 ounces
[6:53 PM] A Random Badger: let me find it
[6:53 PM] A Random Badger: and ill link it
[6:53 PM] A Random Badger: it was an experiment a scientist conducted on a several dying patients
[6:53 PM] A Random Badger: he layed them on a scale
[6:53 PM] fancy: is this weight or mass xd
[6:53 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[6:53 PM] A Random Badger: ill link
[6:53 PM] fancy: I kid
[6:53 PM] A Random Badger: mightve been mass
[6:53 PM] fancy: it's a joke
[6:53 PM] fancy: u monkey
[6:53 PM] A Random Badger: okay
[6:54 PM] A Random Badger: anyways
[6:54 PM] A Random Badger: on average he found
[6:54 PM] A Random Badger: after the final dying breath of the patient
[6:54 PM] A Random Badger: like literally
[6:54 PM] A Random Badger: as soon as the patient died
[6:54 PM] A Random Badger: on average
[6:54 PM] A Random Badger: the body lost a weight of 23 ounces
[6:54 PM] A Random Badger: and he proposed this was our soul, our source of energy, leaving our 3rd dimensional vessel
[6:55 PM] A Random Badger: https://www.historicmysteries.com/the-21-gram-soul-theory/
[6:55 PM] A Random Badger: 21 grams
[6:55 PM] A Random Badger: my msitake
[6:55 PM] A Random Badger: but anyways
[6:55 PM] A Random Badger: my belief and how i tie this into our discussion now
[6:56 PM] A Random Badger: is that we can never witness or soul but we to an extent believe it is there
[6:56 PM] A Random Badger: the only explanation for its existence would be it exists within us on a higher dimension
[6:56 PM] A Random Badger: and when our vessel dies
[6:56 PM] A Random Badger: it leaves
[6:56 PM] A Random Badger: what happesn after
[6:56 PM] A Random Badger: we dont know
[6:56 PM] A Random Badger: we could never know
[6:56 PM] A Random Badger: do our memories persist?
[6:56 PM] A Random Badger: does it find a new vessel?
[6:57 PM] A Random Badger: does heaven and god exist just on a higher dimension we couldnt witness until we died and became one with our souls?
[6:57 PM] A Random Badger: my point is
[6:57 PM] A Random Badger: if there is a purpose to life
[6:57 PM] A Random Badger: we're not gonna find it in the 3rd dimension
[6:57 PM] A Random Badger: we could never find it
[6:57 PM] fancy: perhaps
[6:57 PM] fancy: however
[6:57 PM] A Random Badger: so my personal philosphy is
[6:57 PM] fancy: caveat
[6:58 PM] fancy: science will never be able to give us meaning
[6:58 PM] A Random Badger: I'd rather spend my 3 dimensional life trying to understand as much about the 3rd dimension as possible before i, potentially, ascend to a higher dimension, if i do at all
[6:58 PM] A Random Badger: and if i do
[6:58 PM] A Random Badger: i maybe then i can seek the purpose of human life
[6:58 PM] A Random Badger: and the reason why
[6:59 PM] A Random Badger: is because i will actually be able to fully experience the 3rd dimention without its limitations
[6:59 PM] A Random Badger: as you said we cannot witness all of the 3rd dimension somewhat
[6:59 PM] fancy: no
[6:59 PM] fancy: we can't witness the 4th dimension
[6:59 PM] fancy: is what I said
[6:59 PM] fancy: but yeah sure
[6:59 PM] fancy: umm
[7:00 PM] fancy: so what all that seems to me
[7:00 PM] fancy: is an incredibly faith based argument
[7:00 PM] A Random Badger: ofc
[7:00 PM] fancy: founded in
[7:00 PM] fancy: a desire to never interface with your peers
[7:00 PM] A Random Badger: but thats the basis of almost all discussion of "life purpose"
[7:00 PM] fancy: that's what it strikes me as
[7:00 PM] fancy: uh not really in the same way
[7:00 PM] A Random Badger: well my point is
[7:01 PM] A Random Badger: i'd rather discuss and explore the things within my realm of experience
[7:01 PM] A Random Badger: rather than things i can only speculate about
[7:01 PM] A Random Badger: i find speculation quite uninteresting
[7:01 PM] A Random Badger: i rather know and understand
[7:01 PM] fancy: but the entire guise is speculative
[7:01 PM] fancy: the entire reason you seek to understand things scientifically is because you speculate there could be something higher
[7:02 PM] fancy: no?
[7:08 PM] fancy: It's not like you are unable to know or understand things in other disciplines
[7:08 PM] fancy: But from what you say I wouldn't characterize what you want to do as wanting to understand our current reality
[7:08 PM] fancy: because you don't really
[7:09 PM] fancy: Is that an incorrect characterization?
[7:30 PM] A Random Badger: i think so
[7:30 PM] A Random Badger: i dont personally
[7:30 PM] A Random Badger: seek understanding of things scientifically because i speculate something higher
[7:30 PM] A Random Badger: i simple seek uh
[7:31 PM] A Random Badger: as much understanding as possible
[7:31 PM] A Random Badger: i simply want to understand
[7:31 PM] A Random Badger: there could be nothing higher
[7:31 PM] A Random Badger: but it doesnt effect how i want to live
[7:31 PM] fancy: affect btw
[7:31 PM] A Random Badger: sorry
[7:31 PM] A Random Badger: anyways
[7:31 PM] A Random Badger: no matter how you look at it, this is our only time to be able to understand and experience things in our realm
[7:32 PM] A Random Badger: its like
[7:32 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[7:32 PM] A Random Badger: we can understand
[7:32 PM] A Random Badger: the 2nd dimension
[7:32 PM] A Random Badger: we can experience it to an extent
[7:32 PM] A Random Badger: but we could never truly know the experience of living as a 2 dimensional entity
[7:32 PM] A Random Badger: its the same as now
[7:32 PM] A Random Badger: wether or not
[7:33 PM] A Random Badger: i ascend as a soul to a higher power, with all recolection of memories prior
[7:33 PM] A Random Badger: or wether i reincarnate into another vessel
[7:33 PM] A Random Badger: or i simpy
[7:33 PM] A Random Badger: cease to exist
[7:33 PM] A Random Badger: as far as a
[7:33 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[7:33 PM] A Random Badger: conscious state
[7:33 PM] A Random Badger: is concerned
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: yanno this is the only time for me to seek the udnerstanding and true experience of my dimension
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: i wont truly get that chance again
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: even in reincarnation
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: because my memories wont persist into my new vessel
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: which personally is what i believe in
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: i believe in souls
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: and i believe in reincarnation
[7:35 PM] A Random Badger: i dont necessarily believe ther is a higher power
[7:35 PM] A Random Badger: in the form of an entity
[7:35 PM] A Random Badger: like us
[7:35 PM] A Random Badger: like a god
[7:35 PM] A Random Badger: yanno
[7:35 PM] A Random Badger: i just dont uh
[7:36 PM] A Random Badger: want to concern myself with such trifling matters such as the purpose of life
[7:36 PM] A Random Badger: it doesnt affect me
[7:36 PM] A Random Badger: or the way i live my life
[7:36 PM] A Random Badger: it doesnt matter what i choose to believe
[7:37 PM] A Random Badger: all that matters is what i choose to do with my life given
[7:37 PM] A Random Badger: and id rather spend it fully experiencing and gaining as much knowledge of my domain as possible
[7:38 PM] A Random Badger: because i might not get that again
[7:39 PM] fancy: wew
[7:40 PM] fancy: so like
[7:40 PM] fancy: you're kinda making my argument
[7:40 PM] fancy: but also denying the existence of any non-physical aspect of our current existence
[7:40 PM] fancy: questions of philosophy are what you're doing with your life
[7:41 PM] fancy: like that's fundamentally what philosophy seeks to do
[7:41 PM] fancy: figure out what the oughts are
[7:41 PM] A Random Badger: yes but thats my philosophy yanno
[7:42 PM] A Random Badger: its not so much as
[7:42 PM] fancy: like this entire line of reasoning. you're embarking on is philosophy
[7:42 PM] A Random Badger: denying the existence of anything non-physical
[7:42 PM] fancy: you're just refusing to entertain the idea you might be wrong
[7:42 PM] A Random Badger: its just that, id rather focus on the uh
[7:42 PM] A Random Badger: the given i guess
[7:42 PM] A Random Badger: the stuff i know i can understand
[7:42 PM] fancy: but philosophy is a given
[7:43 PM] A Random Badger: but philosophy doesnt really help me understand my universe or to experience it fully
[7:44 PM] A Random Badger: its like you said
[7:44 PM] A Random Badger: philosophy seeks to understand what we ought to do with our lives
[7:45 PM] A Random Badger: but theres no definitive answer to that
[7:45 PM] A Random Badger: i want the definitive answers
[7:45 PM] fancy: but it does
[7:45 PM] fancy: I mean if you could see all of human existence at once, then yeah philosophy is solvable
[7:46 PM] fancy: but saying the pursuit of philosophy doesn't help you understand the world you live in
[7:46 PM] fancy: is incredibly false
[7:46 PM] A Random Badger: which is why i'd rather worry about when and if i ever reach a higher dimension xd
[7:46 PM] fancy: what you are saying makes sense if you're the only person that exists
[7:46 PM] A Random Badger: cause then i could see all of human existence at once
[7:46 PM] fancy: but you aren't
[7:46 PM] fancy: what makes you think science even can answer any of this
[7:48 PM] A Random Badger: science has given plenty of answer to plenty of things, the bigger question is what has philosophy ever answered? its never really been anything but speculation from what i understand
[7:51 PM] fancy: what do you define as speculation
[8:00 PM] fancy: ??
[8:00 PM] A Random Badger: oh sorry am watching news about the shooting
[8:00 PM] A Random Badger: gimme a bit
[8:01 PM] A Random Badger: jesus
[8:02 PM] A Random Badger: wtf happened that all these school shootings started in recent years
[8:02 PM] A Random Badger: i ask the last generation if this shit happened and apparently it didnt
[8:02 PM] A Random Badger: so why is it happening in this generation
[8:03 PM] fancy: or other shit happened
[8:03 PM] fancy: it's confirmation bias usually
[8:04 PM] A Random Badger: it seems like this shouldnt be a problem in this day of age
[8:04 PM] A Random Badger: i dont understand how we dont have this figured tf out
[8:05 PM] fancy: what
[8:05 PM] fancy: ask your science
[8:06 PM] A Random Badger: science would be able to if politics werent in the fucking way all the time
[8:06 PM] fancy: LOL
[8:06 PM] fancy: science can't solve these problems
[8:06 PM] A Random Badger: everyone just wants to believe if you take guns away this shit wont happen
[8:06 PM] A Random Badger: when it doesnt solve the underlying cause
[8:07 PM] fancy: science will never solve the underlying cause
[8:07 PM] fancy: of why people don't feel happy
[8:07 PM] fancy: that's not a question science can answer
[8:08 PM] A Random Badger: i guess it depends on what you think the udnerlying cause is
[8:08 PM] A Random Badger: is it mental illness?
[8:09 PM] fancy: it's a lot of things
[8:09 PM] fancy: sometimes it's mental illness
[8:09 PM] fancy: sometimes it's general teen anxiety paired with no outlet
[8:09 PM] fancy: sometimes it's overall dissatisfaction with life
[8:10 PM] fancy: it's a very complex question
[8:11 PM] A Random Badger: well the good part is they caught this guy
[8:11 PM] A Random Badger: so they can question the fuck out of him
[8:11 PM] A Random Badger: and if it was up to me
[8:11 PM] A Random Badger: i'd show him how really dissatisfactory life can be
[8:12 PM] A Random Badger: a lot of these things tho
[8:12 PM] A Random Badger: kinda can be solved by science and education, or at elast helped  to an extent
[8:13 PM] fancy: hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[8:13 PM] fancy: so why don't you kill people when they upset you
[8:13 PM] fancy: or steal things
[8:13 PM] fancy: why not do those things
[8:13 PM] A Random Badger: why?
[8:14 PM] A Random Badger: i wonder
[8:14 PM] fancy: how can you criticize what this guy did
[8:14 PM] fancy: on what grounds
[8:26 PM] A Random Badger: well i was raised by parents who taught me about the value of life, the value of self defense and the proper use and intention of weaponry, i made a few, if not many at all, friends and found some outlets, i saught medicinal intervention for my mental problems by request of a caring friend, i was taught that altho there are assholes and people who do bad things in this world its sometimes better to leave them be or reach out to them and step down to their level as a mutual creature of compassion, or at least not to fuck with them and push their buttons. theres lots of things that have made me choose or at least believe its not worth doing those things. i cannot exactly critize the man for what must've happened to him to reach that point but i must still condemn him for his actions. if his problem was mental illness, or not being taught these values or being condemned by other people who rejected him rather than showing him compassion these are things that couldve been helped. the real critizism goes to the potential parents who didnt teach him the values i was taught, or the potential kids that rejected him and bullied him, or the education system for not showing these kids the real consequences of their actions and how important showing compassion to others is rather than shielding their eyes from the horrors of the world, or the critisism could go to the friends and family who didnt help and advise him to seek medicinal or theraputical intervention for his mental illness, and when people say they didnt know about his mental illness then i would critisize them more for not truly opening up to this child enough, god knows i very asily couldve been this kid would i not have been opened up to quite so much that it actually encouraged me to open up a little and seek help.
[8:28 PM] A Random Badger: thats my opinion
[8:28 PM] A Random Badger: and pesonally i think its quite accurate based on the fact that i do face these feelings
[8:28 PM] A Random Badger: i face the feelings of wanting to abandon humanity(edited)
[8:29 PM] A Random Badger: to go out and kill
[8:29 PM] A Random Badger: to kill myself at least
[8:29 PM] fancy: okay so
[8:29 PM] fancy: wew
[8:29 PM] fancy: so most of the people that do these things
[8:29 PM] fancy: understand the consequences
[8:29 PM] fancy: they expect to die doing what they do:
[8:30 PM] fancy: and they're so miserable they would prefer it
[8:30 PM] fancy: but I elaborate
[8:30 PM] A Random Badger: hold on one sec
[8:30 PM] A Random Badger: wait
[8:30 PM] fancy: what
[8:30 PM] A Random Badger: are you referring to to this:  the education system for not showing these kids the real consequences of their actions
[8:30 PM] A Random Badger: because thats not what i meant if its what you're referring to
[8:30 PM] fancy: no
[8:30 PM] A Random Badger: i meant it the other way around
[8:31 PM] fancy: the people that do shootings
[8:31 PM] fancy: know what they're doing
[8:31 PM] fancy: they know it's wrong
[8:31 PM] fancy: they know it will probably end up with them being punished
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: not all of them but yea most of them
[8:31 PM] fancy: that's why most of them end it by killing themselves after everyone else
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: yes
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: thats why mostly
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: i blame that part
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: ill copy it
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: the potential kids that rejected him and bullied him, or the education system for not showing these kids the real consequences of their actions and how important showing compassion to others is rather than shielding their eyes from the horrors of the world
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: thats my personal belief of why they do it
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: imo
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: they dont get the chance to have peers
[8:32 PM] fancy: not always true
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: because kids are assholes
[8:32 PM] fancy: but hold on
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: okay
[8:32 PM] fancy: there's a lot to address
[8:32 PM] fancy: so
[8:32 PM] fancy: first of all
[8:33 PM] fancy: on what grounds do you deem killing to be wrong
[8:33 PM] A Random Badger: on almost all of them other than as a severe punishment to a severe crime such as murder, then i'd more or less say it is just
[8:37 PM] A Random Badger: is that a satisfactory answer?
[8:39 PM] fancy: what
[8:39 PM] fancy: you mean that
[8:39 PM] fancy: every case of killing except as punishment
[8:39 PM] fancy: is morally justified
[8:39 PM] fancy: ?
[8:40 PM] fancy: or is a message missing
[8:40 PM] fancy: 

[8:42 PM] fancy: or do you not understand the question
[8:42 PM] fancy: the question is
[8:42 PM] fancy: why is killing wrong
[8:43 PM] fancy: under what framework, or grounds, do you judge killing to be wrong
[8:44 PM] A Random Badger: almost every case other than as captial punishment for specific circumstances
[8:44 PM] fancy: NO
[8:44 PM] fancy: omg
[8:44 PM] A Random Badger: i cant think of
[8:44 PM] fancy: why
[8:44 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[8:44 PM] fancy: is it wrong
[8:44 PM] fancy: what is wrong
[8:44 PM] fancy: with killing
[8:44 PM] fancy: what makes something morally wrong
[8:45 PM] A Random Badger: what makes it wrong?
[8:45 PM] fancy: yes
[8:45 PM] A Random Badger: our society does
[8:45 PM] A Random Badger: our laws
[8:45 PM] fancy: according to?(edited)
[8:45 PM] A Random Badger: the morality its based off of
[8:45 PM] A Random Badger: it isnt up to me
[8:45 PM] fancy: OH NO
[8:45 PM] fancy: wowlah
[8:45 PM] fancy: woah
[8:45 PM] fancy: wooooah
[8:45 PM] fancy: hold up
[8:45 PM] fancy: do you believe morality is derived from law
[8:45 PM] A Random Badger: you mean law is derived from morality?
[8:45 PM] fancy: no
[8:46 PM] fancy: I mean what I asked
[8:46 PM] A Random Badger: define derived for me then rq
[8:46 PM] fancy: do we base
[8:46 PM] fancy: morality
[8:46 PM] fancy: off of our laws
[8:46 PM] A Random Badger: no we base laws off our morality
[8:46 PM] fancy: okay so
[8:46 PM] fancy: what is the moral justification
[8:47 PM] fancy: for killing to be wrong
[8:47 PM] A Random Badger: can you just give me the answer cause i dont have the words for it rn plus im trying to get team together for practice
[8:48 PM] A Random Badger: its wrong cause theres no sense in it, no accomplishment to be made by it and humans are creatures of intellectual progression in a sense
[8:48 PM] fancy: what
[8:48 PM] A Random Badger: thats my best answer
[8:48 PM] fancy: I'm not giving you the answer lol that defeats the point
[8:49 PM] A Random Badger: i just gave you one
[8:49 PM] A Random Badger: now go
[8:49 PM] fancy: because the answer is depending on your axioms
[8:49 PM] A Random Badger: work with it
[8:49 PM] fancy: okay so
[8:49 PM] fancy: another example
[8:49 PM] fancy: is slavery wrong
[8:49 PM] A Random Badger: yes
[8:49 PM] fancy: why
[8:50 PM] A Random Badger: because every human should have the right to do what they please as long as it doesnt impose on the safety and rights of another human
[8:50 PM] fancy: why
[8:51 PM] A Random Badger: why what? should every human have the right to do what they please?
[8:51 PM] fancy: yes
[8:51 PM] A Random Badger: because its a core principle our country and many others are built off of and one i personally believe in
[8:51 PM] A Random Badger: why do i believe it
[8:51 PM] fancy: okay so 200 years ago that wasn't true
[8:52 PM] fancy: right?
[8:52 PM] A Random Badger: uh yes there was a lot of discrimination against the blacks primarily i think then
[8:53 PM] A Random Badger: that they were somehow
[8:53 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[8:53 PM] A Random Badger: inferior
[8:53 PM] A Random Badger: to whites
[8:53 PM] A Random Badger: which is wrong
[8:53 PM] fancy: and why is that wrong
[8:54 PM] A Random Badger: because the color on their skin doesnt change their intellectual or mental capacity
[8:55 PM] fancy: oh sorry
[8:55 PM] fancy: I meant
[8:55 PM] fancy: to step back
[8:55 PM] fancy: why is it wrong to deny someone's right to autonomy
[8:57 PM] A Random Badger: well i suppose you can trace its root back to christianity
[8:57 PM] A Random Badger: the 10 commandments
[8:57 PM] A Random Badger: tho personally i dont do it for the reason of
[8:57 PM] A Random Badger: "god wills it"
[8:58 PM] A Random Badger: i only agree with it because its the way we as humans have moved forward ever since
[8:58 PM] fancy: so it's right because weve always done it that way?
[8:58 PM] A Random Badger: we've based a lot of our shit on it
[8:58 PM] A Random Badger: mhm and its come with great success
[8:59 PM] A Random Badger: compared to other countries anyways
[8:59 PM] fancy: we had great success enslaving people
[8:59 PM] fancy: that was super good for our economy
[9:00 PM] A Random Badger: yea sure but it betrayed americas core principle of freedom and equality
[9:00 PM] A Random Badger: and they prioritized that
[9:01 PM] A Random Badger: after that
[9:01 PM] A Random Badger: a lot of europe followed suit
[9:01 PM] fancy: hold up
[9:01 PM] fancy: that's not consistent
[9:01 PM] fancy: you said we value autonomy because it's successful
[9:01 PM] fancy: arguably
[9:01 PM] fancy: slavery is more successful
[9:01 PM] fancy: so why is it wrong
[9:01 PM] A Random Badger: when i reference autonomy
[9:02 PM] A Random Badger: i meant
[9:02 PM] A Random Badger: way before
[9:02 PM] A Random Badger: modern civilization
[9:02 PM] A Random Badger: and civilizations that were primarily built off the 10 commandments
[9:02 PM] A Random Badger: some still hung on to slavery too tho
[9:02 PM] A Random Badger: others didnt
[9:02 PM] A Random Badger: until things like
[9:02 PM] A Random Badger: dictatorships and empires became a thing
[9:02 PM] A Random Badger: then it didnt matter
[9:03 PM] A Random Badger: other than one that 1 guy wanted
[9:03 PM] A Random Badger: whatever he wanted went
[9:03 PM] fancy: okay
[9:03 PM] fancy: and do you think
[9:03 PM] fancy: that is morally justified
[9:03 PM] fancy: or not
[9:03 PM] A Random Badger: slavery? no
[9:03 PM] fancy: no
[9:03 PM] fancy: dictatorships
[9:04 PM] A Random Badger: hmmmm
[9:04 PM] A Random Badger: thats interesting
[9:04 PM] A Random Badger: but no
[9:04 PM] A Random Badger: its not
[9:04 PM] A Random Badger: empires maybe
[9:04 PM] A Random Badger: dictatorships no
[9:05 PM] A Random Badger: dictatorships usually result from one guy amassing power and holding his country/nation at gunpoint so to speak
[9:05 PM] A Random Badger: ot at least
[9:05 PM] A Random Badger: in the case of say North Korea
[9:05 PM] A Random Badger: blind its citizens to the outside world
[9:05 PM] A Random Badger: and what life is like elsewhere
[9:05 PM] A Random Badger: which interesting enough
[9:06 PM] A Random Badger: is the current counter strategy against NK
[9:06 PM] A Random Badger: sabotage it from the inside
[9:06 PM] A Random Badger: with propoganda of what the outside world is like
[9:06 PM] fancy: okay skip that
[9:06 PM] A Random Badger: BUT ITS SO INTERESTING AND RELEVENT
[9:06 PM] fancy: why is a dictatorship wrong
[9:06 PM] fancy: No it's not relevant to this discussion
[9:07 PM] A Random Badger: WHHHAAAAAAAAAAHAAAAA
[9:07 PM] A Random Badger: okay
[9:07 PM] A Random Badger: dictatorship is morally wrong because it betrays autonomy
[9:07 PM] fancy: alright
[9:07 PM] fancy: si
[9:07 PM] fancy: so
[9:07 PM] fancy: why is autonomy the ideal
[9:08 PM] A Random Badger: 1 word
[9:08 PM] A Random Badger: encouragement
[9:08 PM] fancy: ?
[9:08 PM] A Random Badger: it encourages people to strive for bigger and better accomplishments
[9:08 PM] A Random Badger: by allowing them to do what they want
[9:09 PM] A Random Badger: compared to forcing people to do something
[9:09 PM] A Random Badger: they dont want to do
[9:09 PM] A Random Badger: history has proven the disparity of the results(edited)
[9:09 PM] fancy: history has also "proven" slavery to be incredibly efficient
[9:10 PM] A Random Badger: efficient economically
[9:10 PM] A Random Badger: yes
[9:10 PM] A Random Badger: but not so much in terms of intellectual advancement
[9:10 PM] A Random Badger: which in turn
[9:10 PM] A Random Badger: betters the economy msot of the time
[9:11 PM] fancy: no because if you use slave labor you can vastly outperform in technological advancement
[9:11 PM] A Random Badger: benefits
[9:11 PM] A Random Badger: might be a better word
[9:11 PM] A Random Badger: really?
[9:11 PM] fancy: yes
[9:11 PM] fancy: it's fucking cheap as fuck labor
[9:11 PM] fancy: it's incredibly efficient
[9:11 PM] A Random Badger: mhm
[9:11 PM] fancy: most slaves are really dumb
[9:12 PM] A Random Badger: mhm
[9:12 PM] fancy: so enslave all dumb people
[9:12 PM] fancy: boom
[9:12 PM] fancy: super efficient advancement
[9:12 PM] A Random Badger: mhm
[9:12 PM] A Random Badger: right
[9:12 PM] A Random Badger: so
[9:12 PM] A Random Badger: thats why
[9:12 PM] A Random Badger: all those countries who currently still follow that philosophy are so incredibly technologically advanced yes?
[9:13 PM] fancy: they don't enslave based on intelligence
[9:13 PM] fancy: they enslave based on race
[9:13 PM] A Random Badger: enslaving dumb people didnt boost technological advancement
[9:13 PM] A Random Badger: education did
[9:13 PM] fancy: WE NEVER
[9:13 PM] A Random Badger: making dumb people smarter did
[9:13 PM] fancy: enslaved dumb people
[9:13 PM] fancy: ever
[9:13 PM] A Random Badger: sure we did
[9:13 PM] fancy: no
[9:14 PM] fancy: we enslaved races
[9:14 PM] fancy: not intelligence levels
[9:14 PM] A Random Badger: but they were dumb
[9:14 PM] fancy: no they were uneducated
[9:14 PM] fancy: not dumb
[9:14 PM] A Random Badger: because they werent granted education
[9:14 PM] fancy: do you understand a difference between educated and intelligent
[9:14 PM] fancy: or acknowledge a difference
[9:14 PM] A Random Badger: i acknowledge the difference i dont necessarily agree with it tho
[9:15 PM] fancy: what
[9:15 PM] fancy: is there a difference
[9:15 PM] fancy: yes or no
[9:15 PM] A Random Badger: yes BUT
[9:15 PM] A Random Badger: here my question
[9:15 PM] A Random Badger: which is more efficient
[9:16 PM] A Random Badger: a dumb person forced to do menial labor
[9:16 PM] A Random Badger: or
[9:16 PM] fancy: in terms of advancement?
[9:16 PM] fancy: the most efficient thing in terms of advancement is focus on the top percentile and use everyone else to serve them
[9:17 PM] A Random Badger: an educated dumb person who chose his career field and works to do what he loves
[9:17 PM] A Random Badger: hmm
[9:17 PM] A Random Badger: not necessarily
[9:17 PM] A Random Badger: advancement is dependant on the economy
[9:17 PM] A Random Badger: and the funding it gets
[9:17 PM] A Random Badger: economy is exponentially increased
[9:17 PM] fancy: once again
[9:17 PM] fancy: slave labor is more efficient economically
[9:17 PM] A Random Badger: when people have the freedom to choose their career
[9:18 PM] A Random Badger: and are educated
[9:18 PM] A Random Badger: only if you care about saving pennies
[9:18 PM] A Random Badger: rather and than making the big bucks
[9:19 PM] fancy: paying all the dumb people nothing and using all their efforts to produce to fund the top percentile
[9:19 PM] fancy: is 100% more efficient
[9:19 PM] fancy: that's not really deniable
