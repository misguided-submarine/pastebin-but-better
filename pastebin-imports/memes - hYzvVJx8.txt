[3:12 PM] fancy: "I've been running out of room in my trash can for my water bottles, but then I discovered that I can crush them and they take up less space"
[3:29 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[3:29 PM] A Random Badger: who
[3:32 PM] A Random Badger: i try dota game
[3:32 PM] A Random Badger: btw
[3:48 PM] fancy: guess who
[3:57 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[3:57 PM] A Random Badger: andrew/
[3:57 PM] A Random Badger: ?
[4:14 PM] fancy: try again
[5:53 PM] A Random Badger: jules?
[5:54 PM] fancy: no it was redman
[5:54 PM] fancy: who else would discover that he could crush plastic bottles
[5:55 PM] A Random Badger: oh i forgot you guys were playing yesterday
[5:55 PM] fancy: and that that makes then take less space
[5:55 PM] A Random Badger: i mean
[5:55 PM] A Random Badger: technically
[5:55 PM] A Random Badger: it doesnt take up less space
[5:55 PM] fancy: I mean
[5:55 PM] fancy: yes
[5:55 PM] fancy: it does lol
[5:56 PM] A Random Badger: i mean
[5:56 PM] A Random Badger: accessibly space sure
[5:56 PM] A Random Badger: accessible*
[5:56 PM] fancy: no it does actually take up less space lol
[5:56 PM] fancy: wtf
[5:57 PM] A Random Badger: technically not
[5:57 PM] A Random Badger: cause
[5:57 PM] A Random Badger: the space inside each water bottle
[5:57 PM] A Random Badger: is technically
[5:57 PM] A Random Badger: unuses
[5:57 PM] A Random Badger: unused
[5:57 PM] fancy: uh
[5:57 PM] fancy: uhhhhhhh
[5:57 PM] fancy: k
[5:58 PM] A Random Badger: i mean i think you know what technicality im trying to get at but im bad at words
[5:58 PM] A Random Badger: xd
[5:58 PM] fancy: I think
[5:58 PM] fancy: I'm reporting u
[5:58 PM] A Random Badger: i mean
[5:58 PM] A Random Badger: im not wrong
[5:58 PM] A Random Badger: you cant just
[5:59 PM] A Random Badger: make an object take up less space without chemically altering it in some way
[5:59 PM] fancy: false
[5:59 PM] A Random Badger: like
[5:59 PM] A Random Badger: melting the plastic
[5:59 PM] fancy: density is a physical property
[5:59 PM] fancy: and can be altered physically
[6:01 PM] A Random Badger: yes but changing the density of something does not technically make it use up less space. by compacting something to be more dense all you're doing is increasing the quanity of mass per unit of volume
[6:02 PM] fancy: which then takes up less space
[6:02 PM] A Random Badger: not necessarily
[6:02 PM] A Random Badger: because the whole point of compacting something
[6:02 PM] fancy: the space between molecules counts as part of the object
[6:02 PM] A Random Badger: is to make compress it in such a way that it doesnt waste space it's not needing
[6:02 PM] fancy: ????
[6:03 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[6:03 PM] fancy: in other words
[6:03 PM] A Random Badger: no
[6:03 PM] fancy: takes up less space
[6:03 PM] A Random Badger: the air in an empty water bottle
[6:03 PM] A Random Badger: is not part of the water bottle
[6:03 PM] fancy: irrelevant
[6:04 PM] A Random Badger: its completely relevent
[6:04 PM] fancy: no
[6:05 PM] fancy: you're trying to tell me that somehow a water bottle takes up the same amount of space crushed and uncrushed
[6:05 PM] A Random Badger: because it does
[6:06 PM] fancy: .....
[6:06 PM] A Random Badger: the space inside the water bottle is not used space by the water bottle
[6:06 PM] A Random Badger: for example
[6:06 PM] fancy: ok have fun filling ur trucks with noncrushed bottles
[6:06 PM] A Random Badger: i can open the water bottle
[6:06 PM] A Random Badger: and put more mass
[6:06 PM] A Random Badger: inside of it
[6:06 PM] fancy: and I'll transport 8x the bottles crushed
[6:07 PM] fancy: gg
[6:07 PM] A Random Badger: sure it's harder to access that unused space and to fill it
[6:07 PM] A Random Badger: but in all technicallity
[6:07 PM] fancy: u go out of business
[6:07 PM] fancy: I don't
[6:07 PM] A Random Badger: it is not taking up
[6:07 PM] fancy: ez game
[6:07 PM] A Random Badger: less or more space either way
[6:07 PM] A Random Badger: thats the whole point of the equation
[6:07 PM] A Random Badger: that density equals the mass divided by volume
[6:08 PM] fancy: and as density goes up, volume goes down
[6:08 PM] A Random Badger: yes but the mass does not change
[6:08 PM] fancy: doesn't matter
[6:08 PM] A Random Badger: mass is the thing that takes up space
[6:08 PM] fancy: false
[6:08 PM] fancy: that's volume
[6:09 PM] fancy: volume is the space
[6:09 PM] A Random Badger: no volume is just the space it can occupy
[6:09 PM] fancy: .....
[6:09 PM] fancy: I have no idea where you learned science lol
[6:10 PM] fancy: mass is the amount of stuff and volume is the space it occupies
[6:10 PM] fancy: sure you a don't change the density of a plastic significantly with human force
[6:10 PM] fancy: however
[6:10 PM] fancy: comma
[6:10 PM] fancy: if you want to argue technicalities
[6:11 PM] fancy: you do affect its actual density as well(edited)
[6:11 PM] fancy: however slightly
[6:11 PM] fancy: Q.E.D. takes up less space
[6:12 PM] A Random Badger: hmm ig in technicality that is correct, im actually arguing against it
[6:13 PM] A Random Badger: or maybe im using words wrong
[6:13 PM] A Random Badger: probably using words wrong
[6:13 PM] A Random Badger: cant think of corret word
[6:13 PM] A Random Badger: correct*
[6:13 PM] A Random Badger: but i think you get the point i was trying to make
[6:14 PM] fancy: yes u tried to go up against a Sicilian when death was on the line
[6:15 PM] fancy: and I secretly have immunity to poison
[6:15 PM] A Random Badger: wat
[6:15 PM] fancy: so I poison us both
[6:15 PM] fancy: ez
[6:15 PM] fancy: watch the princess bride
[6:15 PM] A Random Badger: oh
[6:15 PM] A Random Badger: maybe another time
[6:16 PM] A Random Badger: what is the correct word i should be using?
[6:16 PM] A Random Badger: if you knew what i meant
[6:17 PM] A Random Badger: What is the principle I was thinking of?
[6:17 PM] A Random Badger: Am confused
[6:17 PM] fancy: ur principle is that it's the same amount of stuff
[6:18 PM] fancy: which is true
[6:18 PM] fancy: however comma unless you can crush it while preserving structure of the molecules
[6:18 PM] fancy: idk how you can refrain from changing density
[6:18 PM] A Random Badger: It's no longer she object it once was
[6:18 PM] A Random Badger: The
[6:19 PM] A Random Badger: Wat
[6:19 PM] A Random Badger: Okay let me try words again
[6:19 PM] A Random Badger: It's no longer the same object it was*
[6:19 PM] fancy: explain
[6:20 PM] A Random Badger: Like
[6:20 PM] A Random Badger: The point of a bottle is the space inside of it
[6:20 PM] A Random Badger: If you crush it
[6:21 PM] A Random Badger: It can no longer do that effectively
[6:21 PM] A Random Badger: It's just
[6:21 PM] fancy: when did we move to philosophical purposes of bottles
[6:21 PM] A Random Badger: A pile of plastic
[6:21 PM] A Random Badger: Um
[6:21 PM] A Random Badger: Idk lol
[6:21 PM] fancy: lol
[6:21 PM] fancy: what's your point about it not being the same object
[6:21 PM] fancy: what does that demonstrate
[6:21 PM] A Random Badger: I just said it
[6:22 PM] A Random Badger: Didn't I?
[6:22 PM] fancy: ?_?
[6:22 PM] fancy: yes
[6:22 PM] A Random Badger: It's like you said before
[6:22 PM] fancy: was that it
[6:22 PM] fancy: was that the whole point u were trying to make
[6:22 PM] fancy: that it no longer holes water
[6:22 PM] A Random Badger: Yes lol
[6:22 PM] A Random Badger: Ig
[6:22 PM] fancy: because then yes
[6:22 PM] fancy: that's true
[6:22 PM] A Random Badger: Hahaha
[6:22 PM] fancy: lmao
[6:22 PM] A Random Badger: It is no longer bottle
[6:23 PM] A Random Badger: A use bottle can not preform duty as bottle
[6:23 PM] A Random Badger: Cause*
[6:23 PM] fancy: call it a potato then
[6:23 PM] fancy: or a jdicidj
[6:23 PM] A Random Badger: Wat
[6:23 PM] fancy: it don't care
[6:23 PM] A Random Badger: No
[6:23 PM] fancy: it never lived
[6:23 PM] A Random Badger: You can't just
[6:23 PM] A Random Badger: Make plastic
[6:23 PM] A Random Badger: A potato
[6:23 PM] A Random Badger: It goes from bottle to
[6:24 PM] A Random Badger: Plastic junk
[6:24 PM] A Random Badger: There
[6:24 PM] A Random Badger: Useless
[6:24 PM] A Random Badger: Feels bad about itself
[6:24 PM] fancy: only if it were animate
[6:24 PM] A Random Badger: Lsot it's wife and children
[6:24 PM] fancy: but we don't live in an anime
