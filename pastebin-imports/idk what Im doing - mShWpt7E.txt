3:18 AM] fancy: cus I was gonna ask
[3:18 AM] fancy: if I can ask u something
[3:18 AM] fancy: also what's wrong with plants
[3:21 AM] saucy: what were you going to ask
[3:21 AM] saucy: is it scary
[3:21 AM] saucy: and fuck plants
[3:21 AM] saucy: they killed my family
[3:21 AM] fancy: wtf
[3:21 AM] fancy: how
[3:22 AM] fancy: no it's not scary I don't do scary things
[3:22 AM] fancy: ur the scariest thing in my life
[3:22 AM] fancy: xd
[3:22 AM] saucy: :frowning:
[3:22 AM] saucy: that was meeeeean
[3:22 AM] saucy: just ask
[3:22 AM] saucy: what were u gonna ask
[3:22 AM] fancy: no it's not
[3:22 AM] fancy: cus ur not scary
[3:23 AM] fancy: that was the point doofus
[3:23 AM] fancy: anyway
[3:23 AM] fancy: so like
[3:23 AM] fancy: this came up the other day
[3:24 AM] fancy: cus pizza has been talking to this other girl
[3:24 AM] fancy: I mean
[3:24 AM] fancy: just girl
[3:24 AM] fancy: not other
[3:24 AM] fancy: lol oops
[3:24 AM] fancy: but he mentioned at some point that
[3:25 AM] fancy: they talked about the question of
[3:25 AM] fancy: between like, companionship, sex, and intimacy
[3:25 AM] fancy: what two are the most important to them in a relationship
[3:26 AM] fancy: and that made me think
[3:26 AM] fancy: cus like
[3:26 AM] fancy: if I think about it
[3:26 AM] fancy: I rank intimacy and companionship like really far above sex
[3:26 AM] fancy: cus like at this point
[3:27 AM] fancy: I feel like
[3:27 AM] fancy: what I want is someone who like
[3:27 AM] fancy: likes all the same things I do
[3:27 AM] fancy: like
[3:27 AM] fancy: ALL
3:28 AM] fancy: and would do everything I like to do
[3:28 AM] fancy: but not like
[3:28 AM] fancy: out of a sense of obligation
[3:28 AM] fancy: but cus they also want to do those things
[3:28 AM] fancy: and I think this cus
[3:28 AM] fancy: when I look back at all the people I've dated
[3:29 AM] fancy: I always get bored because they don't like enough of the things I do, no matter how much we have in common
[3:29 AM] fancy: does that make sense
[3:29 AM] fancy: and even with my friends
[3:30 AM] fancy: i like them less when they stop playing games with me
[3:30 AM] fancy: like if I start playing a different game and they don't like it or whatever
[3:30 AM] fancy: and this kinda worries me I guess
[3:30 AM] fancy: cus it's not realistic to expect someone who like
[3:31 AM] fancy: is the same person as I am basically lol
[3:31 AM] fancy: obviously, I wouldn't know if I actually wanted that unless I tried it
[3:31 AM] fancy: but that's the feeling I have right now at least
[3:31 AM] fancy: and I think that partially comes from like
[3:33 AM] fancy: I completely lost my train of thought
[3:33 AM] fancy: oops
[3:33 AM] fancy: but yeah
[3:33 AM] fancy: basically I just always lose interest if I find out they're not as passionate or as into things as I am
[3:33 AM] fancy: maybe that's just like
[3:34 AM] fancy: me not correctly recognizing what's actually important to me?
[3:34 AM] fancy: I'm not sure
[3:34 AM] fancy: but when I think about it, I can't see anything working out if I'm always leaving a person behind to do the things I like to do
[3:35 AM] fancy: since I can't see myself giving up something I enjoy just because a person that I'm with doesn't like to do it with me
[3:35 AM] fancy: and honestly
[3:35 AM] fancy: when that happens
[3:36 AM] fancy: like when someone I'm with doesn't like doing the things I do, I start liking them a lot less
[3:36 AM] fancy: like really quickly
[3:36 AM] fancy: idk if I'm doing a good job explaining this
[3:37 AM] saucy: yeah, i get what you mean
[3:37 AM] saucy: and having things in common is pretty important
[3:38 AM] saucy: i mean like...realistically, you can't like all of the same things
[3:38 AM] saucy: but you still need to have enough common interests so that it doesn't get boring
[3:38 AM] saucy: are you thinking that like, you'll never find something you're like satisfied with?
[3:38 AM] saucy: for that reason?
[3:38 AM] fancy: yeah
[3:38 AM] fancy: I feel like
[3:38 AM] saucy: someone, not something lol
[3:38 AM] fancy: what I'm thinking I want
[3:38 AM] fancy: doesn't exist
[3:39 AM] fancy: which is a very depressing thought
3:39 AM] fancy: but like for example
[3:39 AM] fancy: it bothers me even to have different friends I play different games with
[3:39 AM] fancy: instead of just like
[3:39 AM] fancy: doing everything with someone
[3:41 AM] saucy: so it does sound like you value companionship a lot, if you want to basically be with someone that you can do everything with
[3:41 AM] saucy: i think it's kind of like important to know
[3:42 AM] saucy: that love isn't necessarily about finding the perfect someone that fits all of your needs and wants
[3:42 AM] saucy: but more about finding someone you care so much about that you'll accept them even with their flaws
[3:43 AM] saucy: which i know really isn't like reassuring to hear
[3:43 AM] saucy: do you just prefer like the same few close friends over having many?
[3:43 AM] saucy: like do you find it tiresome to be friends with too many people?
[3:44 AM] fancy: uhh
[3:44 AM] fancy: yeah
[3:44 AM] fancy: tiresome and stressful
[3:44 AM] fancy: I can't balance more than a couple people
[3:44 AM] fancy: like it feels bad to leave to go play a game with other people just cus the first group doesn't want to do it
[3:44 AM] fancy: it makes me feel really shallow but like
[3:45 AM] fancy: honestly it's really hard for me be very interested if people don't do things with me
[3:46 AM] saucy: you feel like they don't care enough to do what you want?
[3:46 AM] saucy: and that kind of like hurts you a bit?
[3:46 AM] fancy: it's not so much about caring, I don't think. it's just like
[3:46 AM] fancy: if they don't like doing the things I like doing
[3:46 AM] fancy: it just feels really like
[3:46 AM] fancy: pointless I guess
[3:46 AM] fancy: like if we don't do things together, then what's left?
[3:48 AM] fancy: and I have the same problem if too many people want to do different things with me
[3:48 AM] fancy: like when one group wants to dota but someone else wants to play PAD and someone else wants to play Destiny or something
[3:48 AM] fancy: and I want to do all those things but I also don't want to tell anyone no
[3:49 AM] fancy: so that's why I was thinking that I want one person who would do it all
[3:49 AM] fancy: and like
[3:49 AM] fancy: this isn't even getting into the love part as much
[3:49 AM] fancy: cus I think I'm honestly like
[3:49 AM] fancy: my expectations and ideas of how things work
[3:49 AM] fancy: are so fucked up
[3:49 AM] fancy: idk
[3:52 AM] saucy: i think it kind of sounds like it's too tiresome for you to like friends with too many people
[3:52 AM] saucy: not really sure how to explain it
[3:52 AM] saucy: like you don't really want to "take care" of so many people
[3:52 AM] saucy: and i mean take care as in more like entertain people, i guess
[3:53 AM] saucy: so it's more convenient for you if you had a friend that just liked everything you did
[3:53 AM] saucy: so you can just do whatever you want whenever, and you know that someone will also want to do the same things with you
[3:54 AM] fancy: yeah that's pretty accurate
[3:54 AM] fancy: I guess that's due to like
[3:54 AM] fancy: how much more important doing things together is for me
[3:54 AM] fancy: over like anything else
[3:55 AM] fancy: so it feels like there's no relationship when I'm not actively doing stuff together with someone
[3:55 AM] fancy: like honestly if you asked me to name like
[3:55 AM] fancy: another element
[3:55 AM] fancy: of a relationship
[3:55 AM] fancy: I couldn't
[3:55 AM] fancy: like doing things together seems like everything to me
[3:56 AM] fancy: like that's
[3:56 AM] fancy: all there is
[3:56 AM] saucy: ah okay, i think i am starting to understand a bit better
[3:57 AM] saucy: you know the 5 love languages, where people have like a preference to express their love
[3:57 AM] fancy: ye
[3:57 AM] fancy: we've talked about those before
[3:57 AM] saucy: quality time is one of them, and that's probably like your major one
[3:57 AM] saucy: yeah lol
[3:57 AM] fancy: I don't remember what it was last time we did this
[3:57 AM] fancy: lol
[3:57 AM] fancy: I know that gifts is like -500
[3:57 AM] fancy: that's all I remember
[3:57 AM] saucy: lol yeah, i remember you don't like gifts
[3:58 AM] saucy: so how would you feel if there was like a friend that really liked spending time with you
[3:58 AM] fancy: so
3:58 AM] saucy: and they might not necessarily like the exact same things as you do
[3:58 AM] saucy: but they're willing to try it with you?
[3:58 AM] fancy: uhhh
[3:58 AM] fancy: fuck
[3:58 AM] fancy: so like
[3:58 AM] fancy: I feel like another part of my personality causes conflict here
[3:58 AM] fancy: cus I really really dislike
[3:59 AM] fancy: when people do things that they don't really want to do
[3:59 AM] fancy: if that makes sense
[3:59 AM] fancy: like if you're not gonna be passionate about it, just stop
[3:59 AM] fancy: so
[3:59 AM] fancy: idk
[3:59 AM] fancy: it feels like there would be a thin line
[3:59 AM] fancy: always
[3:59 AM] fancy: where like
[3:59 AM] fancy: yeah I'd like there to be someone that would try the stuff I like
[4:00 AM] fancy: but if like
[4:00 AM] fancy: they clearly weren't into it but they kept along cus they felt like I'd appreciate it
[4:00 AM] fancy: I'd get annoyed really fast
[4:00 AM] fancy: kinda related but
[4:00 AM] fancy: I will admit that
[4:00 AM] fancy: uhhh
[4:00 AM] fancy: remember when you were thinking about maybe coming to visit
[4:01 AM] fancy: and then things worked out that you didn't have to
[4:01 AM] fancy: cus ur tickets got refunded or something idr
[4:01 AM] saucy: ya
[4:01 AM] fancy: so
[4:01 AM] fancy: I know that
[4:01 AM] fancy: you didn't mean anything by that at all
[4:01 AM] fancy: and like
[4:01 AM] fancy: objectively
[4:02 AM] fancy: it's not that big a deal
[4:02 AM] fancy: but it made me kinda sad
[4:02 AM] fancy: cus I was looking forward to meeting you and just doing whatever just like hanging out
[4:02 AM] fancy: even tho there like wasn't a plan really
[4:02 AM] fancy: and
[4:02 AM] fancy: we didn't even know what we could do here
[4:02 AM] fancy: lol
[4:07 AM] fancy: but anyway
[4:08 AM] fancy: I just brought that up cus like
[4:08 AM] fancy: it kinda points toward the
[4:08 AM] fancy: quality time thing
[4:08 AM] fancy: or whatever
[4:08 AM] fancy: but I think I just take it too extreme I guess
[4:08 AM] fancy: cus like
[4:08 AM] fancy: how many people exist
[4:09 AM] fancy: that could stand me
[4:09 AM] fancy: every day
[4:09 AM] fancy: for like
[4:09 AM] fancy: ever
[4:09 AM] fancy: lol
[4:09 AM] saucy: i mean if you get married, at least one person will
[4:09 AM] saucy: did it make you feel bad when pizza brought that up the other day?
[4:09 AM] fancy: big if
[4:10 AM] fancy: in what way
[4:10 AM] fancy: I mean it made me feel bad cus like
[4:10 AM] fancy: it made me think about what I value
[4:10 AM] fancy: and I kinda feel like I have expectations or dreams that just
[4:10 AM] fancy: aren't based in reality
[4:11 AM] saucy: i kind of feel like that too honestly, like maybe i am being a bit picky with my relationships
[4:11 AM] saucy: and i was wondering if i should like lower my standards or something
[4:11 AM] saucy: but then you'd just be lying to yourself
[4:12 AM] saucy: and doing something you wouldn't want to do
