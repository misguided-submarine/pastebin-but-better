7:19 PM - fancy: but if multiple people tell you the same thing, it's more likely you should consider what they're saying
7:20 PM - fancy: especially when what they are saying has to do with how you make them feel
7:21 PM - fancy: Second point
7:21 PM - fancy: if you are to assume we are trying to construe your actions in some way they shouldn't be
7:22 PM - fancy: there are two things we have to consider here
7:22 PM - fancy: either 1. we have some vendetta against you
7:22 PM - fancy: which I think is demonstrably false
7:23 PM - fancy: or 2. there's a persistent reason that's underlying why we are in a state to perceive your actions in a harsher light than we would normally
7:23 PM - fancy: to elaborate
7:23 PM - fancy: a lot of the things you do can be shurgged off or taken as a joke in a vacuum
7:23 PM - fancy: however once you establish a pattern, then you start to use up patience and your actions begin to wear on people
7:23 PM - fancy: do you disagree with anything I've said so far
8:02 PM - A Random Badger: sorry btw was occupied
8:02 PM - A Random Badger: uh not really
8:02 PM - fancy: okay
8:02 PM - fancy: so do you think that either 1 or 2 are consistent with reality?
8:05 PM - A Random Badger: i mean yea i dont think its vendetta but i think number 2 would make sense but i think a 3rd possibility would simply bbe that you wish you validate your annoyance or smth
8:05 PM - A Random Badger: to validate*
8:05 PM - fancy: well that's really just a rephrasing of the second option
8:05 PM - A Random Badger: oh is it
8:05 PM - fancy: yeah
8:05 PM - A Random Badger: ok
8:06 PM - fancy: so
8:06 PM - fancy: why do you think we would be in a state like that
8:08 PM - A Random Badger: oh i feel like it could be a number of things, like just a personal strife to always be right, a personal strife to just want to compete at everything even personal debates and such, could be something silly like you had a bad day and shit's been pushing your buttons to begin with etc
8:08 PM - fancy: you're using strife wrong btw
8:08 PM - fancy: but anyway
8:08 PM - A Random Badger: bbut you get what i mean?
8:08 PM - fancy: I understand what you mean
8:08 PM - A Random Badger: ok
8:08 PM - fancy: so let's think about this
8:09 PM - fancy: is that a good explanation for something that consistently occurs between you and us
8:09 PM - fancy: is it likely that every time we have these disagreements, it's because we had a bad day, or we just decided we need to be right
8:09 PM - fancy: and is that consistent with how we operate otherwise
8:10 PM - A Random Badger: i dont think its a consistent thing for every time but i think theres occasions where that seems to be the case and i especially felt that way for the last incident
8:10 PM - fancy: so you don't think it could have anything to do with anything you've done?
8:11 PM - A Random Badger: oh no i think its wrong to assume its a one way street
8:11 PM - A Random Badger: period
8:11 PM - fancy: right, so you acknowelge that it's at least possible that we reacted the way we did because of things you have done
8:12 PM - A Random Badger: ofc and this actually reminds me of my train of thought from earlier that ties into a problem i have and that i do think is somewhat consistent with you guys and why i will often either leave or become especially stubborn to partake in the debbate at any serious level
8:17 PM - A Random Badger: and that is that nearly every time there's some sort of confliction between me and one of you it will turn into this huge arguement in text chat on the server which on its own is fine bbut the probblem becomes when it turns into a collective of you guys all ganging up on me for occasionally the silliest of things and misunderstandings and i always find that to be insulting which is why i will leave or just refuse to take it seriously and thats a bbig reason why i left the server and dont want to come back, both to avoid situations like that from happening and also because it often seems like the goal of the collective is to shame me or invalidate me for my thoughts or actions and make me look bad to the entire discord server and i feel like it has largely succeeded in that goal which is why i have left. to clarify i dont think that is actually the goal of any of those occurances but that is the effect it often leaves and usually afterwards ill end up having a one on one conversation with either you or pizza that goes fine but it doesn't change what happened in server chat
8:18 PM - A Random Badger: if that makes sense
8:18 PM - fancy: I think you have a really quesitonable opinion of server chat
8:18 PM - fancy: because I don't think you really understand that absolutely no one reads my server chat
8:19 PM - fancy: and there's only like 4 people that are ever active
8:20 PM - fancy: but anyway
8:20 PM - A Random Badger: but its still the fact that instead of having a calm one on one debate, it consistently descends into verbal assault from a collective group who just happen to share similar opinions
8:20 PM - fancy: shouldn't that suggest to you that your perception is pretty faulty
8:20 PM - fancy: if everyone is consistently telling you that you're pretty wrong about things
8:20 PM - fancy: also not to forget the earlier point
8:20 PM - fancy: I'm pretty sure I was a lot more patient earlier on
8:21 PM - fancy: but you have a tendency to be pretty un-agreeable
8:22 PM - A Random Badger: i think that would be the case if it often wasn't a matter of subjectivity
8:22 PM - fancy: explain?
8:22 PM - fancy: I think that going to the subjective argument actually hurts your point
8:24 PM - A Random Badger: even ignoring the subjectivity i often feel like the primary reason isn't because you all individually feel the same but rather because they all look to you of whether or no you think something is right or wrong and will just bandwagon it so to speak because you're often the smartest person in the server
8:24 PM - fancy: people don't bandwagon me at all
8:24 PM - fancy: that's a pretty inaccurate view of my friends
8:25 PM - A Random Badger: yet i can have one on one conversations with either you or pizza that go entirely differently
8:25 PM - fancy: he's a lot more patient than I am
8:25 PM - fancy: but that doesn't change much tbh
8:25 PM - fancy: I'm usually the only one yelling
8:27 PM - fancy: he's also a lot more willing to allow concessions and be feels-y
8:27 PM - A Random Badger: theres plenty of times people like julian and fucking yoshi will join the bandwagon
8:27 PM - fancy: not really
8:27 PM - fancy: yoshi wants no part in any of it
8:27 PM - fancy: he thinks you're dumb and he thinks I'm dumb for engaging if you want the truth
8:27 PM - fancy: he doesn't really get involved
8:27 PM - fancy: and julian actually gives 0 fucks
8:27 PM - fancy: he gives fewer fucks about people than anyone I know
8:27 PM - fancy: he's like
8:28 PM - fancy: the most laid back person about that kind of thing that i know
8:30 PM - A Random Badger: idk where else to go with it then
8:30 PM - A Random Badger: ill be honest
8:33 PM - A Random Badger: a lot of the time i just can't figure out how to explain myself and the thoughts going through my head and i blame the reason of never being able to accomplish anything with explaining myself to you to simply the fact that you are just better than me when it comes to words and making an arguement to the point i just get frustrated because i know what i think and what i feel but i can't figure out how to explain it and then you will just say its a struggle to validate my feelings rather than anything objective and idk which case is really true
8:34 PM - fancy: this is probably due to what I think is a fundamental belief that you know better than most everyone else
8:34 PM - fancy: you don't really accept anything I say from my experience
8:34 PM - fancy: unless it's like super obviously concrete
8:34 PM - fancy: like 1 = 1
8:34 PM - A Random Badger: no its not that
8:34 PM - A Random Badger: its like
8:34 PM - fancy: you say all the time that I'm not understanding you when I probably am
8:34 PM - fancy: i've lived through this period of life
8:35 PM - fancy: obviously it's not exactly the same
8:35 PM - fancy: but I've dealt with these issues before
8:35 PM - fancy: it's not like I have no idea what you're trying to convey
8:35 PM - fancy: but you kinda just assume that no one else can understand you because you're not perfect at explaining yourself
8:35 PM - A Random Badger: i cant figure out how to explain what i think
8:36 PM - fancy: and somehow you seem to think that I'm really good at explaining myself
8:36 PM - fancy: when I'm pretty mediocre
8:36 PM - fancy: I've just had a lot more practice
8:36 PM - fancy: relative to you
8:36 PM - fancy: but it's all about a back and forth and a two way conversation
8:36 PM - fancy: which goes back to the railroad meme where you kinda try to force conversations which makes it really hard for ideas to go back and forth
8:37 PM - fancy: cus it's like fitting a square peg in a round hole
8:37 PM - A Random Badger: it often just feels like we're speaking 2 different languages
8:37 PM - A Random Badger: and im trying to like
8:38 PM - A Random Badger: explain it to you in your language
8:38 PM - A Random Badger: but im really abd at your language
8:38 PM - A Random Badger: bbut you dont know my language at all
8:38 PM - A Random Badger: it feels like that
8:38 PM - fancy: I would disagree with me not knowing your language
8:38 PM - fancy: but like i've said
8:38 PM - A Random Badger: no i didnt mean it like that
8:38 PM - fancy: I'm willing to put money on this being due to you thinking you are somehow different or something
8:38 PM - A Random Badger: like
8:38 PM - fancy: or special in some way
8:38 PM - fancy: and that I can't understand you or something
8:39 PM - fancy: or that you know something that I don't that makes what I say not really apply
8:39 PM - fancy: that's really what it feels like
8:39 PM - A Random Badger: no i dont think its that
8:40 PM - A Random Badger: yanno how like
8:40 PM - A Random Badger: theres 2 forms of thought processing
8:40 PM - A Random Badger: some people will process their thoughts just in like a spoken language just like how their talking
8:40 PM - A Random Badger: and some people process their thoughts in illustration
8:40 PM - A Random Badger: idk what it is called
8:40 PM - A Random Badger: i just recently found out about it
8:41 PM - A Random Badger: i feel like im one of those people who thinks in illustration format  and its just really difficult for me to convey those thoughts in words effectively especially when im already really bad at vocabulary anyways
8:41 PM - fancy: this sounds like a feels vs logic distinction
8:41 PM - A Random Badger: uh let me look it up
8:42 PM - A Random Badger: apparently its a real thing
8:42 PM - fancy: yeah but you also thought that souls having weight was a real meme
8:42 PM - fancy: but it's not
8:42 PM - fancy: so
8:43 PM - A Random Badger: idk this isnt going anywhere clearly
8:43 PM - fancy: you're the only one that ever says that
8:44 PM - A Random Badger: and do you seem to think this is getting anywhere?
8:44 PM - fancy: it's getting more places than it usually does
8:44 PM - fancy: like when I get upset and start yelling
8:44 PM - fancy: now I'm just upset
8:44 PM - fancy: I just think it's relevant that you hardly every conceed anything I say
8:45 PM - fancy: and your only arguments otherwise are based on feelings
8:45 PM - fancy: like things about "well everyone always does whatever you say"
8:45 PM - fancy: or thinks what I think
8:46 PM - fancy: there is a long track record of my friends heavily disagreeing with a ton of what I think about the world
8:46 PM - fancy: for example
8:46 PM - fancy: and this is relevant to something else I might have touched on before
8:47 PM - fancy: Feelings are valid, yes, but you can also always examine why you feel certain ways about certain things, and you can determine how reasonable that feeling is
8:47 PM - fancy: which is why when you say things like "I feel ganged up on because everyone just does what fancy does"
8:47 PM - fancy: and I say "well no they don't really always follow what I think"
8:48 PM - fancy: you should probably take that and go "hmm, okay, seeing as they don't really do that in most situations, maybe that indicates in this situation that I'm not in line with what most people seem to think"
8:48 PM - fancy: because looking everyone in the face and going "no, you're all wrong, I'm right, and I know better because I know my side and if you only considered it, you'd see xyz was actualy acceptable" or something, is pretty indicative of either extreme arrogance or extreme naivete
8:50 PM - fancy: which was my whole point about the "no one likes history" meme being out of place, but we weren't even that upset about the joke itself, becuase if you had just said "oh my b it was just a joke" we probably would have moved on, but instead you just got really stubborn and tried to tell us why it was okay
8:51 PM - A Random Badger: actually i beleive i said hm and left
8:51 PM - fancy: I can walk you through the entire progression of the conversation following the history meme if you want
8:51 PM - fancy: no you didn't
8:51 PM - fancy: you spent a good whiel rationalizing it
8:51 PM - fancy: here
8:51 PM - fancy: we shall revist
8:51 PM - fancy: revisit
8:51 PM - fancy: https://puu.sh/A5pju/3d88597bc4.png
8:51 PM - fancy: initial comment
8:51 PM - fancy: normally a whatever bad meme joke
8:52 PM - fancy: however because you had set us on edge by being inconsiderate we took it poorly
8:52 PM - fancy: as so: https://puu.sh/A5pkK/23f106798d.png and https://puu.sh/A5pl7/c95924f879.png
8:52 PM - fancy: I'm obviously more tilted than pizza
8:52 PM - fancy: because I'm generally on edge more because I'm a huge target for really bad memes about trying to upset me
8:53 PM - fancy: https://puu.sh/A5pn3/34691c270e.png
8:53 PM - fancy: other part of my response
8:53 PM - fancy: at this point your response if you really meant nothing by it was to say "oh my b it was joke haha"
8:53 PM - fancy: instead you go here: https://puu.sh/A5poe/bd8b58adcc.png
8:54 PM - fancy: https://puu.sh/A5poI/51bd895c9c.png
8:54 PM - fancy: which is generally a combative and disagreeable response
8:54 PM - fancy: and kinda inflammatory
8:54 PM - fancy: in a situation that's already inflamed
8:54 PM - A Random Badger: that is because i did not realize it was inflamed
8:54 PM - fancy: you can stop me at any point you start to disagree btw
8:54 PM - A Random Badger: and i thought everything was fine
8:54 PM - fancy: oh
8:54 PM - fancy: okay so
8:54 PM - fancy: did you think my response
8:54 PM - fancy: was one where I wasn't annoyed
8:55 PM - fancy: do I generally start doing 1 word lines and saying wtf and what the fuck and stuff like that when I'm not annoyed
8:55 PM - fancy: or teling people to fuck off
8:55 PM - A Random Badger: that is because at the time of you typing i am already typing i beleive
8:56 PM - fancy: https://puu.sh/A5psh/7be4d1cae1.png this came before you responded
8:56 PM - A Random Badger: if i remember correctly the 3 but's came before th fuck off
8:56 PM - fancy: https://puu.sh/A5psz/cc605065d8.png
8:56 PM - fancy: this was after 3 buts
8:56 PM - fancy: so then we continue
8:56 PM - A Random Badger: yes
8:56 PM - A Random Badger: it was not until i saw that message that i realized it was inflamed
8:56 PM - A Random Badger: and i was already beginning to type my next respone
8:57 PM - fancy: so why didn't you just say oh it was bad joke my b
8:57 PM - fancy: that would have solved everything
8:57 PM - fancy: literally
8:57 PM - A Random Badger: 2 reasons
8:58 PM - A Random Badger: #1 by the initial responses i thought it was fine and situation was not inflamed and you were just being moderately agitated like you sometimes just are, and #2 because i thought by continueing the meme that would emphasize that it was, indeed, just a joke
8:59 PM - fancy: haven't we had a ton of interactions where you do this thing
8:59 PM - fancy: that I've explicitly explained just upsets me
8:59 PM - A Random Badger: idk
8:59 PM - fancy: and you continue to do it despite that
8:59 PM - fancy: what other message should I draw than one of you just don't give a fuck about me
8:59 PM - fancy: and to address 1
8:59 PM - fancy: once I said "fuck off"
9:00 PM - fancy: wouldn't that indicate to you that I'm not actually having a good meme
9:00 PM - fancy: actually
9:00 PM - fancy: we should address some thing first
9:00 PM - fancy: do you think I enjoy the memes of deliberately upsetting me
9:00 PM - fancy: for luls
9:00 PM - fancy: or being "moderately agitated" like I sometimes am
9:01 PM - A Random Badger: there are not many times where my memes are ever deliberate towards uupsetting someone
9:01 PM - fancy: you pretty deliberately try to upset me
9:01 PM - fancy: most people do
9:01 PM - A Random Badger: not often
9:02 PM - A Random Badger: occasionally i have
9:02 PM - fancy: often enough
9:02 PM - fancy: but that's not the question
9:02 PM - A Random Badger: but most of the time it is just a meme
9:02 PM - fancy: okay so
9:02 PM - fancy: the question was
9:02 PM - fancy: do you think I enjoy that meme
9:02 PM - fancy: or do you think I'm legitimately upset
9:02 PM - A Random Badger: by the fuck off?
9:02 PM - A Random Badger: at the time that i read that
9:03 PM - A Random Badger: that was when i decided to say
9:03 PM - A Random Badger: hm
9:03 PM - fancy: or in general
9:03 PM - A Random Badger: and leave
9:03 PM - fancy: do you think I enjoy the "upset fancy" memes in general
9:03 PM - fancy: where people intentionally say things in ways
9:03 PM - fancy: that they know will upset me
9:03 PM - fancy: you actually did that a lot
9:03 PM - fancy: when we played minecraft
9:03 PM - fancy: because you thought it was funny or something idk
9:03 PM - fancy: you would just say really really stupid things
9:03 PM - fancy: that you probably didn't believe
9:03 PM - fancy: but you thought we'd laugh or something idk
9:04 PM - A Random Badger: yes that is often my sense of humor
9:04 PM - A Random Badger: it was delberated to upset you
9:04 PM - fancy: rephrase that last sentence?
9:04 PM - fancy: I think you missed a word
9:04 PM - fancy: maybe
