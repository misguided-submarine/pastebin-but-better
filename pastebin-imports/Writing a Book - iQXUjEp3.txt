[2:13 PM] fancy: write a book
[2:13 PM] fancy: :thumbsup:
[2:13 PM] A Random Badger: why would i write a book
[2:14 PM] A Random Badger: that like
[2:14 PM] A Random Badger: goes against everything i stand for
[2:14 PM] A Random Badger: that is like the biggest risk per amount of commited time i could think of
[2:19 PM] fancy: you don't have to write a book for the purpose of selling it
[2:19 PM] fancy: and that's not why I'd recommend you write
[2:20 PM] A Random Badger: thats not what i mean
[2:20 PM] A Random Badger: i meant risk in not liking it and feeling like it was a waste of time
[2:20 PM] A Random Badger: i used to write when i was a kid
[2:20 PM] A Random Badger: i dont anymore
[2:21 PM] fancy: badger
[2:21 PM] fancy: fundamentally
[2:21 PM] fancy: you seem to think everything is a waste of time
[2:24 PM] fancy: writing is good for you
[2:24 PM] fancy: putting down your thoughts on paper helps give you perspective
[2:28 PM] A Random Badger: oh well you shouldve been more specific, when you said book i thought you meant along the lines of a novel, not a journal
[2:28 PM] A Random Badger: still
[2:28 PM] A Random Badger: i dont see how putting things on paper gives any better of a perspective than just thinking about it
[2:28 PM] fancy: it does
[2:28 PM] fancy: it gets them out of your head
[2:29 PM] fancy: also novel, journel, short story, it's all the same
[2:29 PM] fancy: it gets you out of your own head
[2:33 PM] fancy: even the stuff you write to me when we're talking
[2:34 PM] fancy: we should go back and revisit it
[3:21 PM] A Random Badger: Uh idk
[9:12 PM] A Random Badger: if i leave the server am i gonna be flamed this time
[9:13 PM] A Random Badger: (why?) ive embarrassed myself enough and i dont want any part in future discussions there
[9:16 PM] A Random Badger: well im going to. not like i plan on using it for voice chat anytime soon either since i dont have stuff i play with you guys now that io left dota
[9:16 PM] fancy: I mean
[9:16 PM] fancy: simply put
[9:16 PM] fancy: I think that's a dumb decision
[9:16 PM] fancy: I think that's you pushing people away again
[9:17 PM] A Random Badger: only people who dont care for me anyways
[9:17 PM] A Random Badger: lol
[9:17 PM] A Random Badger: half of them dont now me anyways
[9:17 PM] A Random Badger: and prob dont want to
[9:17 PM] fancy: badger
[9:17 PM] fancy: you really should stop
[9:17 PM] fancy: doing that
[9:17 PM] fancy: I don't see how you can possibly say
[9:17 PM] fancy: after all this
[9:17 PM] fancy: that we don't care about you
[9:17 PM] A Random Badger: im not saying you and pizza
[9:18 PM] A Random Badger: i just dont want to be in the server
[9:18 PM] A Random Badger: cause i dont want to be caught in any of these conversations anymore
[9:18 PM] A Random Badger: and msot of the people in there idk and they dont know and we dont care to know each other either
[9:20 PM] A Random Badger: like if i want to talk to you guys or dos tuff that can be done just here in pms or another server so
[9:21 PM] fancy: I told you what I think about it
[9:23 PM] A Random Badger: i mean its not like im pushing away people i already know
[9:23 PM] A Random Badger: so
[9:23 PM] fancy: You say that like you ever get to know people
[9:23 PM] A Random Badger: no i say that as in i dont know anyone in there but you and pizza
[9:24 PM] fancy: It's just another opportunity to get to know some good people that you're throwing away
[9:24 PM] fancy: because that's what you do
[9:24 PM] fancy: and then you complain about not having friends
[9:24 PM] A Random Badger: they dont want to know me at this point im sure
[9:24 PM] fancy: ?
[9:24 PM] fancy: are you going to make me
[9:24 PM] fancy: @everyone
[9:24 PM] fancy: and ask

[9:26 PM] fancy: they all do their own thing
[9:26 PM] fancy: and we're all still friends
[9:26 PM] fancy: I don't understand how that's a problem
[9:27 PM] fancy: where did you learn that friends always have to do the same things together
[9:29 PM] A Random Badger: i mean either way im pretty incapable when it comes to talking to people and making friends so its not like its gonna happen
[9:29 PM] fancy: if you don't try
[9:29 PM] fancy: you'll never get better
[9:30 PM] A Random Badger: yes but i aslo dont want many friends anyways because i am bad at keeping up with people. god knows how many people hate me already because of that
[9:30 PM] fancy: probably literlaly no one
[9:30 PM] A Random Badger: oh no
[9:30 PM] A Random Badger: lots
[9:30 PM] A Random Badger: i get shit for it all the time
[9:31 PM] fancy: then you don't want to know them anywya
[9:31 PM] fancy: and you just say
[9:31 PM] fancy: that's life
[9:31 PM] fancy: I mean unless they're sending you messages
[9:31 PM] fancy: and you're just ignoring them
[9:31 PM] fancy: I have lots of friends I only talk to occassionally
[9:31 PM] fancy: like do you think we're all born
[9:31 PM] fancy: knowing how to talk to people
[9:32 PM] A Random Badger: no but it is incredibly awkward to talk to and adult who hasnt learned how to when they should have been taught growing up
[9:32 PM] fancy: no badger
[9:32 PM] fancy: it's really not
[9:32 PM] fancy: like
[9:32 PM] fancy: if you don't talk to people
[9:32 PM] fancy: you're just going to be
[9:32 PM] fancy: 30
[9:32 PM] fancy: and not know
[9:32 PM] fancy: is that better
[9:32 PM] fancy: ?
[9:32 PM] fancy: like we're all fucking
[9:32 PM] fancy: 20
[9:33 PM] fancy: we're all kids
[9:33 PM] A Random Badger: yes but my plan is seclusion and dying anyways and i try to maintain that path
[9:33 PM] fancy: you're fucking absurd
[9:33 PM] fancy: you don't want that
[9:33 PM] fancy: and I can't help you unless you stop lying to yourself and to everyone
[9:33 PM] fancy: no one wants that
[9:33 PM] fancy: you're just afraid of success
[9:34 PM] fancy: so you make an excuse to not try
[9:34 PM] A Random Badger: because ive never gotten lucky with anything ive ever tried to succeed at
[9:34 PM] fancy: badger
[9:34 PM] fancy: you're fucking
[9:34 PM] A Random Badger: only things that i dont care abot

[9:34 PM] fancy: we're all barely people yet
[9:35 PM] fancy: your entire life so far has been dictated by parents
[9:35 PM] fancy: and everything you do have any success at you write off as useless
[9:35 PM] fancy: and then you stop trying
[9:35 PM] fancy: you give up at the first hint of difficulty or failure
[9:35 PM] fancy: of course you won't succeed
[9:38 PM] A Random Badger: i didnt try to become lucky at gambling, i just was, i didnt try to be smart, i just was etc. i tried i make friends in school, i didnt, i tried to get into college and leave, i didnt, i tried to be good at certain games, i didnt, etc its all still luck and i dont think that will ever be disproven for me
[9:38 PM] fancy: BADGER
[9:38 PM] fancy: why do you just
[9:38 PM] fancy: accept
[9:38 PM] fancy: like
[9:38 PM] fancy: the first
[9:38 PM] fancy: sign of struggle
[9:38 PM] fancy: you fucking peace
[9:38 PM] fancy: and call it a day
[9:38 PM] fancy: and are like welp that's a failure oh well
[9:39 PM] fancy: you are a self fulfilling prophecy

[9:39 PM] fancy: a 790 in reading
[9:39 PM] fancy: a 780 in the other fucking category
[9:40 PM] A Random Badger: nvm theres no point arguing against it
[9:40 PM] fancy: badger at some point you need to realize
[9:40 PM] fancy: you're just assuming things
[9:40 PM] fancy: with no reason to
[9:40 PM] fancy: when was the last time
[9:41 PM] fancy: you dedicated
[9:41 PM] fancy: yourself
[9:41 PM] fancy: to doing something
[9:41 PM] fancy: instead of just giving up after a week
[9:41 PM] A Random Badger: meeting people at work
[9:41 PM] A Random Badger: learning dota
[9:41 PM] A Random Badger: learning go
[9:41 PM] fancy: yeah
[9:41 PM] A Random Badger: learning starcraft
[9:41 PM] fancy: and guess what
[9:41 PM] fancy: you're pretty fucking good at go
[9:42 PM] A Random Badger: no
[9:42 PM] fancy: compared to people who haven't learned anything
[9:42 PM] fancy: yes
[9:42 PM] A Random Badger: im not lo
[9:42 PM] fancy: badger

[9:42 PM] fancy: I've been playing for 5k hours
[9:42 PM] fancy: I'm sitll shit
[9:42 PM] fancy: you just downplay
[9:42 PM] fancy: your own accomplishments
[9:42 PM] fancy: and then use that as an excuse to quit
[9:42 PM] fancy: and you just assume what other people think
[9:42 PM] A Random Badger: in the case of dota i just stopped enjoying it
[9:42 PM] fancy: and you put words in their mouths
[9:43 PM] A Random Badger: thats all there was tro it
[9:43 PM] fancy: like all you do is scramble to put some shoddy rationlization together
[9:44 PM] A Random Badger: yep
[9:45 PM] fancy: and you claim that's a good line of logic
[9:45 PM] A Random Badger: i dont think i did claim it was
[9:45 PM] fancy: you claim we don't respect your opinions
[9:46 PM] A Random Badger: i still do
[9:46 PM] fancy: would you respect someone that wasn't being at all logical
[9:46 PM] fancy: their opinions rather
[9:46 PM] A Random Badger: depends on how they
[9:46 PM] A Random Badger: are
[9:46 PM] A Random Badger: some random idiot
[9:46 PM] fancy: no it doesn't badger
[9:46 PM] A Random Badger: no
[9:46 PM] A Random Badger: nvm
[9:46 PM] fancy: badger I alreayd know the answer
[9:46 PM] fancy: I've seen you
[9:46 PM] fancy: you would be like wtf is wrong with them
[9:46 PM] fancy: I saw it with hope
[9:47 PM] fancy: we have nothing against you
[9:47 PM] fancy: but your logic isn't logical
[9:47 PM] fancy: you can't just call it logic because you want it to be
[9:47 PM] fancy: like have you read some of the stuff you say
[9:47 PM] A Random Badger: i do
[9:47 PM] A Random Badger: and i still agree with msot of it
[9:47 PM] fancy: https://puu.sh/y8S3M/9222076ee0.png
[9:47 PM] fancy: do you not see
[9:47 PM] fancy: the absurdity
[9:48 PM] fancy: in what you said
[9:48 PM] A Random Badger: i still agree with my reasoning
[9:48 PM] fancy: what reasoning
[9:48 PM] fancy: how is that reasoning
[9:48 PM] fancy: "I thought I was treating people better, but eh who needs people anyway"
[9:49 PM] fancy: do you not see
[9:49 PM] fancy: how those two attitudes
[9:49 PM] fancy: cannot coexist
[9:49 PM] A Random Badger: because i thought i was but i clearly was not so thus there was no point to continue
[9:49 PM] fancy: holy shit
[9:49 PM] fancy: why the fuck
[9:49 PM] fancy: do you just
[9:49 PM] fancy: give up
[9:49 PM] fancy: instantly
[9:49 PM] A Random Badger: that wasnt instantly
[9:49 PM] fancy: why do you think you're gonna be perfect on the first try
[9:49 PM] A Random Badger: that was after
[9:50 PM] A Random Badger: a few weeks
[9:50 PM] fancy: yeah but did you ask for feedback
[9:50 PM] fancy: no
[9:50 PM] fancy: this was the first time
[9:50 PM] fancy: you got feedback
[9:50 PM] fancy: and you were like
[9:50 PM] fancy: welp
[9:50 PM] fancy: abandon ship
[9:50 PM] A Random Badger: indeed
[9:51 PM] A Random Badger: because i do not have he will power to focus on so many different things while also trying to keep myself on top of my responsibilities and try to relax and keep myself from stressing out
[9:51 PM] fancy: more excuses
[9:51 PM] fancy: smh
[9:51 PM] A Random Badger: at this time of the day i need to just turn off my head or ill go fucking insane
[9:51 PM] fancy: mayube
[9:52 PM] fancy: you should take some of our advice
[9:52 PM] fancy: and get out of your own head
[9:52 PM] fancy: you live in your own head all day
[9:52 PM] fancy: 24/7
[9:52 PM] fancy: of course you're going to go insane
[9:52 PM] A Random Badger: because writing stuff down does not make any logical sense at all
[9:52 PM] fancy: it doesn't have to
[9:52 PM] A Random Badger: how tf does writing my thoughts make me feel better
[9:52 PM] fancy: because feelings
[9:52 PM] fancy: aren't logical
[9:52 PM] fancy: that's the entire point of feelings
[9:52 PM] fancy: we're not robots
[9:53 PM] A Random Badger: all it does ismake me commit to having to think about things so that i can put them on paper to review later which just means having to think about them more when i do not want ot think about those things and i just want to be brain dead
[9:54 PM] fancy: it helps
[9:54 PM] fancy: badger
[9:54 PM] fancy: why do you think we're all lying to you
[9:55 PM] A Random Badger: because id rather just do things my own way and hope one day i go brain dead and never have to think again and then ill never be bothered about anything and to me that sounds like an ideal scenario
[9:55 PM] fancy: no one actually believes that
[9:55 PM] A Random Badger: i do
[9:55 PM] fancy: no you don't
[9:55 PM] fancy: you're just working yourself into a corner
[9:55 PM] fancy: and trying to rationalize it
[9:55 PM] fancy: and you end up with these absurd conclusions
[9:56 PM] A Random Badger: they're not absurd to me
[9:56 PM] fancy: that's false
[9:56 PM] fancy: if it were another person
[9:56 PM] fancy: coming to you
[9:56 PM] fancy: and saying this shit
[9:56 PM] fancy: you'd be like wtf is wrong with you that makes no sense
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: yes because giving people hope allows them to try to make things better
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: however
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: i do not believe in hope
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: hope does not effect me
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: hope is illogical
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: hope means nothiong
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: hope fixes nothing
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: hope helps nothing
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: hope is useless to have
[9:58 PM] fancy: oh cut it out
[9:58 PM] A Random Badger: there is no place in my life for hope
[9:58 PM] fancy: you're so full o fit
[9:58 PM] fancy: you claim to be a bastion of logic
[9:58 PM] fancy: and everything you argue
[9:58 PM] fancy: is from feeling
[9:58 PM] fancy: from EMOTION
[9:58 PM] fancy: you honestly
[9:58 PM] fancy: with all due respect
[9:59 PM] fancy: is get over yourself
[9:59 PM] A Random Badger: id rather just be numb like i am now and not have to feel concern
[10:00 PM] fancy: oh leave it out
[10:00 PM] A Random Badger: ugh i only have 2 hours before i should sleep
[10:00 PM] A Random Badger: thats the only thing im concerned about no
[10:01 PM] A Random Badger: now*
[10:01 PM] A Random Badger: i have to figure out something to do
[10:01 PM] fancy: maybe
[10:01 PM] A Random Badger: to keep me occupied
[10:01 PM] fancy: work on getting over yoruself
[10:01 PM] fancy: and deciding to live
[10:01 PM] fancy: instead of being a joke
[10:02 PM] A Random Badger: that really just doesnt sound like fun. sounds like something that will stress me out and prevent me from sleeping which will stress me out more because ill have work in the morning and ill be tired while cimultaneously being stressed over the fact that i didnt use my time wisely
[10:02 PM] A Random Badger: and ir eally dont want to be stressed
[10:02 PM] A Random Badger: on my day off
[10:03 PM] A Random Badger: not anymore than i already have already at least
[10:04 PM] A Random Badger: besides how does one "get over oneself"
[10:08 PM] fancy: That kinda just confirms that you haven't listened to anything we've said for the past month.
[10:09 PM] A Random Badger: i mean i have but i dont know how im supposed to piece it together like some kind of puzzle
[10:10 PM] A Random Badger: tell myself that i want to be happy and have a life?
[10:10 PM] A Random Badger: you think i coud convince myself of that?
[10:12 PM] A Random Badger: because i dont
[10:13 PM] fancy: and neither did I
[10:13 PM] A Random Badger: and you needed to take 1 really ahrd fall in order to
[10:13 PM] A Random Badger: unfortunately for me im way to careful to allow that to happen to me any time soon
[10:13 PM] fancy: No I didn't badger
[10:15 PM] A Random Badger: can i just go play a game and try to enjoy myself that way and put it off for another day
[10:15 PM] fancy: that will just be your excuse tomorrow
[10:15 PM] A Random Badger: but im still not entirely convinced today anyways
[10:15 PM] A Random Badger: how am i supposed to break myself when theres no weakness
[10:16 PM] fancy: hwo many times do you have to try playing a game and having it not be the answer before you realize you should maybe try something else
[10:17 PM] fancy: what happened to your ability to give up on the first failure in this instance
[10:17 PM] fancy: I can't make you want to live life
[10:17 PM] fancy: I can just explain how there is good in life and how it's worth living for
[10:17 PM] A Random Badger: playing a game isnt to strive to make thigns better its just to make me numb or at least distract me and it msotly works
[10:18 PM] fancy: bull
[10:18 PM] fancy: shit
[10:18 PM] fancy: you complain regularly
[10:18 PM] fancy: about how you're disatisfied(edited)
[10:18 PM] fancy: that it wasn't fun
[10:18 PM] fancy: or it didn't do anything for you
[10:18 PM] A Random Badger: in dota i did
[10:18 PM] fancy: same for sc
[10:18 PM] fancy: you did
[10:18 PM] fancy: same for stardew you did
[10:18 PM] fancy: when are you going to stop avoiding your issues and start living
[10:19 PM] fancy: for someone who claims to care about wasting time
[10:19 PM] fancy: you actively choose to waste it quite often.
[10:19 PM] fancy: that's what i"m tlaking about when I say you dont' believe the shit you say
[10:20 PM] A Random Badger: i know but theres just no convincing myself
[11:23 PM] A Random Badger: at least i find myself enjoying watching these streams and stuff and thats enough for me
[11:23 PM] A Random Badger: ill take that over stressing myself out
[11:24 PM] fancy: we r memers
[11:25 PM] A Random Badger: my memes werent good enough but this is okay
[11:25 PM] fancy: wat u mean
