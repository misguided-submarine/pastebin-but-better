[6:53 PM] shin: so I thought we had agreed to start early which is why I am still up
[6:53 PM] Renew: we had not
[6:53 PM] Renew: it was semi spoken about where only half the people responded
[6:53 PM] Renew: like normal
[6:54 PM] shin: one day someone will take charge I believe in it
[6:54 PM] Renew: also i think we can only fit like 2 or 3 hours earlier based on the graph
[6:54 PM] shin: I'm going to bed in an hour
[6:54 PM] Renew: go now
[6:54 PM] Renew: then wake for raid
[6:54 PM] shin: not happening
[6:55 PM] Renew: :|
[6:55 PM] shin: when I sleep I'm gone until tomorrow
[6:56 PM] shin: I'm pretty sure everyone has voiced either a desire or willingness to start earlier
[6:57 PM] Renew: i think i remember drusko saying he wanted less hours not starting earlier
[6:57 PM] Renew: but ill wait till he shows up then ask i guess
[7:09 PM] Bad Manderville Man: @predator
[7:09 PM] Bad Manderville Man: he's a master story teller
[7:10 PM] Bad Manderville Man: @dark souls static  wait is today rip then?
[7:10 PM] Bad Manderville Man: if Shin needs to sleep
[7:11 PM] Bad Manderville Man: one day we'll prog light rampant :smile~1:
[7:12 PM] predator: bro
[7:12 PM] predator: are we not playing today
[7:13 PM] Bad Manderville Man: I'd like too
[7:14 PM] Bad Manderville Man: I think Shin might be shleep now tho
[7:14 PM] Bad Manderville Man: we should have all clarified yesterday that we'd be ready to go at (1 hour 15 minutes ago)
[7:15 PM] Bad Manderville Man: because now Shin has adapted his sleep I think to suit that time
[7:15 PM] Bad Manderville Man: but not everyone was on board
[7:15 PM] Bad Manderville Man: with the earlier start
[7:15 PM] Renew: shin got up early thinking we were starting early but apperently were are missing people so hes going back to sleep
[7:15 PM] Bad Manderville Man: our communication skills...might need...work
[7:16 PM] Bad Manderville Man: clarity
[7:16 PM] shin: shin got up early because he passed out at like 5pm yesterday
[7:16 PM] Bad Manderville Man: too many bacon sammies
[7:16 PM] shin: because his sleep schedule gets fucked by staying up until 1-3 every night
[7:16 PM] Bad Manderville Man: wtf ur talking in 3rd person that's so cool
[7:16 PM] shin: ikr
[7:16 PM] Bad Manderville Man: imma start doing that
[7:17 PM] Bad Manderville Man: zane will start doing that.
[7:17 PM] shin: shin likes to go to bed at normal people times like 10-11pm since it's better for you
[7:17 PM] Bad Manderville Man: thankies :heart:
[7:17 PM] predator: are we not starting soon then
[7:17 PM] Bad Manderville Man: we should have started over an hour ago
[7:18 PM] Bad Manderville Man: if we were going to start 3h early
[7:18 PM] Bad Manderville Man: had me bacon sammy and coffee lined up...
[7:18 PM] predator: i said we should become available at any time between now and our original start time
[7:18 PM] predator: and then we’ll agree to play for a certain amount of time after we start
[7:19 PM] predator: this way we can decide when we want to begin depending on the day
[7:19 PM] Bad Manderville Man: zane is concerned
[7:19 PM] predator: and we wont lose time to someone showing up 30 minutes late
[7:19 PM] Bad Manderville Man: he is worried that others will just come at normal time anyway if given a variable time
[7:20 PM] shin: I don't want to have variable starting time be the plan
[7:20 PM] Bad Manderville Man: ^
[7:20 PM] shin: that is a bad plan
[7:20 PM] Bad Manderville Man: it needs to be set otherwise it's going to be a mess
[7:20 PM] predator: why not
[7:20 PM] Bad Manderville Man: because some people will be around earlier then waiting around for 1 fuckin guy
[7:20 PM] Bad Manderville Man: like every single session
[7:20 PM] shin: because I don't want to not know when my commitments are
[7:20 PM] predator: but you do
[7:21 PM] shin: not if we planned on a variable start time
[7:21 PM] predator: i dont understand how
[7:21 PM] Bad Manderville Man: variable start just puts on another potential 3 hours or so we can spend on call just waiting around
[7:21 PM] Bad Manderville Man: hanging about waiting
[7:21 PM] predator: we said we’re all available to start early
[7:21 PM] predator: and we were also obviously available to start at our original time
[7:22 PM] Weston: im so sweaty
[7:22 PM] predator: we should orient to start as early as we can
[7:22 PM] Bad Manderville Man: :gaygaygaygaygaygaygaygaygaygay:
[7:22 PM] shin: starting earlier != variable
[7:22 PM] predator: but if people keep showing up late and things happen to change the time
[7:22 PM] shin: I want a planned schedule so I can plan the rest of my life
[7:22 PM] predator: if we decide we do it based on the number of hours rather than a set time we’ll lose less time
[7:24 PM] predator: the variable time is meant to accommodate your plans not make them more difficult
[7:25 PM] predator: also that’s not the way it’s meant to work zane
[7:26 PM] predator: we dont have to wait for other people to become available, we’re just all here and as soon as everyone is available we start
[7:26 PM] predator: it’s not like we’re waiting around
[7:26 PM] Bad Manderville Man: It's not meant to work like that, but the people who actually turn up early are going to be punished rofl
[7:26 PM] Bad Manderville Man: we are though
[7:26 PM] Bad Manderville Man: If I want to go out
[7:26 PM] Bad Manderville Man: I can't, just in case the last few people show up during
[7:26 PM] predator: if you want to go out then go out
[7:26 PM] predator: and we’ll start later
[7:27 PM] shin: do you understand that is less convenient to plan around
[7:27 PM] predator: it wouldnt be if all of you would communicate your plans to the group
[7:27 PM] shin: I don't want to find out every day at 6pm whether we are starting at 7 or at 9
[7:27 PM] shin: just pick a time and everyone commit to show up this is not difficult
[7:27 PM] predator: if zane wanted to go out one day he could just tell us and we’d know when we’d have to start
[7:28 PM] Bad Manderville Man: Can we just have a set time, so there's a definite point of time we need to be there.
[7:28 PM] Bad Manderville Man: instead of being in Limbo
[7:28 PM] shin: ^
[7:28 PM] predator: we should default to starting as early as we’re able
[7:28 PM] shin: we should schedule a time and people should honour the commitment.
[7:28 PM] predator: that’d be great
[7:29 PM] predator: if people would actually show up on time
[7:29 PM] predator: which they never do

[7:29 PM] Bad Manderville Man: lol
[7:29 PM] predator: and then we lose even more time
[7:29 PM] predator: i mean what do you guys want
[7:29 PM] predator: what you’re suggesting doesnt work
[7:29 PM] Bad Manderville Man: It should work
[7:30 PM] shin: I've told you what I want
[7:30 PM] predator: but it doesnt
[7:30 PM] Bad Manderville Man: and I don't see the alternative working, or even being preferable.
[7:30 PM] predator: then what do you suggest zane
[7:30 PM] Bad Manderville Man: and the vagueness is just stressful
[7:30 PM] Bad Manderville Man: set time
[7:30 PM] predator: because what exists now doesnt work
[7:30 PM] predator: that doesnt work
[7:30 PM] Bad Manderville Man: but a bit earlier and just make sure everyone is on the same boat
[7:30 PM] predator: suggest something else
[7:30 PM] Bad Manderville Man: and available
[7:30 PM] Bad Manderville Man: that's all we can do
[7:31 PM] Cest: Starting at 3 and playing for 4 hours is optimal for me
[7:31 PM] Cest: Because that means no break as well
[7:31 PM] Cest: I'll just eat after
[7:31 PM] Renew: everyone is able to start 2 or 3 hours earlier i believe?
[7:31 PM] Cest: Yes
[7:31 PM] Bad Manderville Man: ask that when everyone is here
[7:31 PM] Bad Manderville Man: lol
[7:31 PM] Bad Manderville Man: otherwise the exact same thing will happen
[7:31 PM] Renew: WE DID
[7:31 PM] Cest: We have a time sheet
[7:32 PM] Renew: and people only half answered
[7:32 PM] Cest: Unless someone lied
[7:32 PM] Weston: i would like to pitch a 4 hour book club reading session instead of playing ff
[7:32 PM] Renew: ew books
[7:32 PM] shin: moth you are contributing negatively
[7:32 PM] Cest: I only like reading before bed
[7:32 PM] Cest: Very relaxing
[7:33 PM] predator: if we start at 6 we had better start at 6
[7:33 PM] Cest: Yes
[7:34 PM] Cest: I'm glad we're not playing rn I'm washing my mouse pads
[7:34 PM] Cest: Lol
[7:34 PM] Bad Manderville Man: I'm reading my mouse pad
[7:34 PM] Cest: Omfg
[7:34 PM] shin: where's your backup mousepads
[7:34 PM] Cest: @Renew
[7:34 PM] Cest: THERE IS A TIME SHEET
[7:34 PM] Cest: It exists
[7:35 PM] Cest: Read it
[7:35 PM] Cest: It says availability
[7:35 PM] shin: I'm
[7:35 PM] shin: legitimately
[7:35 PM] Renew: I READ IT ALREADY
[7:35 PM] shin: going to develop a drinking problem
[7:35 PM] Bad Manderville Man: drink my
[7:35 PM] shin: I will drink ur blood Zane
[7:35 PM] Renew: AND PEOPLE ONLY HALF ANSWERED WHEN I ASKED IN THE FC 2 DAYS AGO SO IM ASKING EVERYONE ONE BY ONE
[7:35 PM] Cest: Then why are you dming me asking my availability
[7:35 PM] Bad Manderville Man: guess that'll do
[7:35 PM] Cest: Aaaaaaaaa
[7:35 PM] shin: we don't need questions just someone actually be in charge that isn't me
[7:35 PM] shin: I don't want to babysit
[7:35 PM] shin: I refuse.
[7:36 PM] shin: I'm already doing a disproportionate amount of work
[7:36 PM] shin: someone else step up
[7:36 PM] Cest: If someone answered wrong when we talked about time sheet availability we can flame them
[7:36 PM] Cest: Until then just go off of it
[7:36 PM] Cest: Smh
[7:36 PM] predator: i already made my suggestion
[7:36 PM] Renew: im asking everyone one by one so you can all confirm it instead of me asking in the FC chat and then half the people answering then being confused on the times
[7:36 PM] Weston: how about
[7:36 PM] Weston: no game
[7:36 PM] Weston: and we watch total recall
[7:36 PM] Renew: might as well watch total recall today since i don't think we are raiding
[7:37 PM] predator: we should be
[7:37 PM] predator: right now
[7:37 PM] Renew: not everyone is even up right now
[7:37 PM] Cest: Maybe our fc members should totally recall the availability times
[7:37 PM] predator: who isnt
[7:37 PM] predator: baja?
[7:37 PM] Cest: :emet:
[7:37 PM] predator: baja is the only one not here
[7:37 PM] Cest: Calvin and Baja
[7:37 PM] predator: and i dont know if he is or isnt
[7:37 PM] predator: it says calvin is online
[7:37 PM] Cest: Nvm Calvin is awake now
[7:37 PM] Cest: Yeah
[7:37 PM] predator: @-w- stop appearing offline

[7:38 PM] Cest: You are forgetting what shin said pred
[7:38 PM] predator: idk what he said

[7:38 PM] Renew: :sfcSicko:
[7:38 PM] Bad Manderville Man: I bet this is what kills most statics
[7:38 PM] Bad Manderville Man: not Shiva
[7:38 PM] shin: no
[7:38 PM] shin: it's not
[7:39 PM] Cest: Lol
[7:39 PM] shin: most statics have the ability to make a schedule and show up
[7:39 PM] Bad Manderville Man: o
[7:39 PM] Cest: Schedule savage
[7:39 PM] shin: we are developmentally challenged
[7:39 PM] Bad Manderville Man: we are as loose as a wizards sleeve
[7:39 PM] Cest: Wtf
[7:39 PM] Cest: Gay
[7:39 PM] Bad Manderville Man: if u wnna make it like that
[7:39 PM] predator: i guess cest isnt going to say what he was referring to
[7:39 PM] Cest: Shin said he's going to bed
[7:39 PM] Weston: what can i do to contribute the failure of this movement
[7:39 PM] predator: lol
[7:40 PM] Renew: keep asking for total recall
[7:40 PM] Cest: Lol
[7:40 PM] Weston: hey guys
[7:40 PM] Cest: Hello weston
[7:40 PM] Weston: lets watch total recall
[7:40 PM] Cest: No!

[7:40 PM] Weston: remember when we watched starship troopers twice and said lets watch total recall nex
[7:40 PM] Weston: t
[7:40 PM] predator: moth im going to start deleting your messages
[7:40 PM] Renew: yea i remember
[7:40 PM] Cest: Lmao
[7:41 PM] Weston: pred a tor total recall is about space and mars and the future
[7:41 PM] Cest: This discord is a society
[7:41 PM] Weston: some of your favorite things
[7:41 PM] Cest: I'm putting my phone down and going back to washing mouse pads
[7:41 PM] Cest: Lol
[7:41 PM] Weston: u know what i just realized
[7:41 PM] Weston: which is really weird
[7:41 PM] Renew: is ferret online?

[7:41 PM] predator: yes
[7:41 PM] Weston: my milk expires halo 3s release date
[7:42 PM] predator: guess we’re not raiding today
[7:42 PM] predator: again
[7:42 PM] Weston: and im like 90% sure the same thing happened when halo 2 came out
[7:42 PM] predator: literally no reason why other than people not communicating
[7:42 PM] Renew: is he on ff14 rn?
[7:43 PM] predator: i hope shin also realizes that if he sleeps now he’s going to sleep completely through the entirety of our availability
[7:43 PM] shin: shin said this
[7:43 PM] Bad Manderville Man: We'll need to have a serious discussion next time we assemble
[7:43 PM] shin: because shin thought from our previous discussion on Monday
[7:43 PM] shin: we all agreed to start earlier
[7:43 PM] predator: we’re assembled right now
[7:43 PM] Bad Manderville Man: having a discussion now isn't good, since ferret, cavlin and Baja aren't here
[7:43 PM] Bad Manderville Man: no
[7:44 PM] predator: and we’re discussing it
[7:44 PM] Bad Manderville Man: we're not all here lol
[7:44 PM] shin: which is why I did not nap at 5 when I stopped working
[7:44 PM] predator: ferret is reading this
[7:44 PM] predator: and i assume calvin is too
[7:44 PM] Bad Manderville Man: assumptions is why we think everyone will turn up an hour 45 ago
[7:44 PM] shin: I believe in someone's ability to one day take responsibility and step up
[7:44 PM] shin: that is all I have to say
[7:44 PM] predator: and i dont think it’s difficult for baja to show up when we need him so long as we tell him when we need him
[7:45 PM] Bad Manderville Man: If it isn't happening today just make sure we are playing tomorrow so we can all talk in VC
[7:45 PM] Renew: tomarrow starts at normal time then we see if we can adjust
[7:45 PM] Bad Manderville Man: and work something out, because this isn't a problem with peoples schedules right.
[7:46 PM] Bad Manderville Man: just a lack of clarity of what's going on and people aren't ready at the right time
[7:46 PM] Bad Manderville Man: and fuck around for ages
[7:46 PM] shin: ok then I'm napping tomorrow
[7:47 PM] predator: also yes we have to decide now what we’re doing tomorrow
[7:48 PM] Renew: start normal time tomarrow
[7:48 PM] Weston: would u want an ass like that zane
[7:48 PM] Bad Manderville Man: what do you mean?

[7:57 PM] Bad Manderville Man: I'm keen for that if everyone is on board
[7:58 PM] Cest: Lmao

[7:58 PM] Cest: This is going to end in disaster again
[7:58 PM] Cest: 2?
[7:58 PM] Renew: 2 hours earlier
[7:58 PM] Cest: Why not 3
[7:59 PM] Renew: I am waiting for a response from baja
[7:59 PM] Renew: BECAUSE I ALREADY ASKED
[7:59 PM] Bad Manderville Man: :hairline:
[7:59 PM] shin: stop asking
[7:59 PM] Cest: Why are you not asking for 3h like we talked about
[7:59 PM] shin: choose a time

[8:00 PM] Cest: Since people are just gonna get confused otherwise

[8:00 PM] shin: I need you guys to be able to figure this one out otherwise my faith in humanity will legitimately reach 0
[8:00 PM] Renew: ask everyone 1 by 1
[8:00 PM] Cest: ಠ ل͟ ಠ
[8:01 PM] Bad Manderville Man: we put all our stats into being sick nasty gamers
[8:01 PM] Cest: Lmao
[8:01 PM] Bad Manderville Man: sorry
[8:01 PM] Renew: the onyl reason we had an original scedule is because ferret asked everyone 1 by 1 to make sure everyone personally agreed
[8:01 PM] Cest: Renew stop asking people about a random 3rd time that nobody talked about at any point before
[8:01 PM] Cest: :m1ns:
[8:01 PM] Bad Manderville Man: dissension gang
[8:01 PM] Bad Manderville Man: :emet:
[8:02 PM] Renew: you said 2 to 3 hours earlier in the beginning
[8:02 PM] Renew: fuck
[8:02 PM] Bad Manderville Man: physical pain
[8:02 PM] Cest: :EHEHEHE:
[8:02 PM] predator: normal time then
[8:03 PM] Cest: Yeah
[8:03 PM] Cest: And we will come to an agreement tomorrow when everyone is here
[8:03 PM] Cest: Lol
[8:03 PM] Renew: normal time
