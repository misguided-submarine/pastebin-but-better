Personally I am just big fan of fallout series
Plus
I would ask that you refrain from referencing fallout 4 as an rpg just so you are aware cause it is no rpg

what is it then lol

A Random Badger - Today at 12:02 AM
An action adventure game
With open world
In the fallout setting
I'll refer you to my review if you seek more explanation

fancy - Today at 12:06 AM
idk Wikipedia calls it an rpg
I trust wikipedia
and like u go get to pretend ur a dude that you're not so that's playing a role
and it's a game
sooooo

I disagree with your premise
RPGs don't have to be a build your own character
in fact most are not
it's a shitty rpg sure
byproduct of being shitty game
but still rpg
most jrpgs are in fact 0 player control over the personality of the characters(edited)

A Random Badger - Today at 12:18 AM
Ah but even jrpgs allow the player to build upon that character and choose drastically differing desicions that can impact the game a wider scale. That is most often the minimum requirement to be considered an rpg otherwise we could call any game where you have to play a specific character that isn't you, say call of duty or that one game I can't remember with the guy that climbs and stuff kinda like lora croft in her series, an rpg. Fallout 4 has character building on a physical level, as in you literally alter and create the appearance of the character you want to play as, but as far as the game play goes, you do not truly get the freedom most rpgs and even jrpgs allow. Instead you are playing Bethesdas character with w.e appearance you want him or her to be in their linear story line where the only decision you get to really choose is what faction to join and maybe decide the fate of a few npcs. That's it though. You do not create your own story, you do not get to shape and model your character on a mental level. You cannot be evil or bad in any sense unless you simply don't want to play the story line and you just wanna be the lone raider. Fallout 4 is much more similar in comparison to tomb raider and that other game with cool guy that I never played but is really popular than it is to whatever jrpg or modern rpg you could name.

is the witcher an rpg

A Random Badger - Today at 12:20 AM
Uh dunno never really played the game much, at least I didn't really get to parts that included decesion making

fancy - Today at 12:20 AM
well
it is
lol
but like
you don't get that much control over his actual "mental" progression
you're playing a story
I see it as teh same in fallout 4
the story might be shit sure
also most jrpg's you get very little freedom to do anything to the characters
it's basically all predefined
esp in things like FF
even in mass effect the endings are all roughly the same
and I think that's considered an rpg

A Random Badger - Today at 12:23 AM
Yes tho I and I think most people would not consider them rpgs. Most traditional rpgs are the isometric ones anymore

fancy - Today at 12:23 AM
like any way you're trying to disqualify fallout disqualifies a lot of other games
I don't think most people consider fallout 4 to be not an rpg

A Random Badger - Today at 12:23 AM
I'd beg to differ because there been a pot of outrage over it since it's release
Lot*
Not pot

fancy - Today at 12:24 AM
that's always tainted by confirmation bias
the people who think it's an rpg don't go into outrage lol
just like in r/dota all the people that don't give a shit about streamer drama never say anything about streamer drama
or the people that like a patch don't make shitposts about how bad the patch is

A Random Badger - Today at 12:25 AM
Sure and the same could be said for the flip side of the coin tho

fancy - Today at 12:25 AM
and most of the outrage I heard was just that it was incredibly disappointing
and what

A Random Badger - Today at 12:25 AM
There are some people who disagree but just don't give enough of a shit

fancy - Today at 12:25 AM
yes
but NONE of the people who think it's an rpg
are going to raise a stink
that HEY THIS GAME IS AN RPG
cus
why would they lol
so I think fallout 4 is an rpg
just a bad one
and that position has had the most convincing logic from what I'm reading
like games that aren't rpgs are like
dota
or rocket league
or for example
bioshock
is not an rpg
but I think that fallout 4 has more in common with rpgs than with bioshock-esque games

A Random Badger - Today at 12:30 AM
Ugh nevermind I hate how I can't finish typing an argument before you start on with another point

fancy - Today at 12:30 AM
even if it underperforms
I mean you can keep typing lol
I'm going to keep saying things as I think of them lol
I do have the ability to go backwards and re-visit things
that's like half the beauty of text conversations
which suck in every other dimension

A Random Badger - Today at 12:31 AM
W.e I've wasted too much time anyways, you know I'm very concerned about my time management so I'm cutting off here before I waste more of it

fancy - Today at 12:32 AM
idk in what world talking about interesting things is a waste of time
I swear I live in twilight zone
also for the record
in the same vein as u were kinda put-off by my "maybe" answer
I'm also a little offended by the proclamation that talking about things with me is a waste of time
soooo
just food for thought

A Random Badger - Today at 12:35 AM
because im not a conversationalist, i dont not pesonally enjoy conversation, and when i find myself spending more time on conversation that i could spend doing more meaningful things to me like actually playing a game and enjoying myself or studying or practicing i get depressed and anxious because i feel like i wasted all that time i couldve spent doing those things that i already have limited amount of time to be able to do when i could make conversation on a far less limited time frame

fancy - Today at 12:35 AM
I'm not telling you that you're wrong to think the way you do
but on the topic of
you feeling that people dont' want to spend time with you
and that whole conversation
you have to realize that you have to talk to people about stuff to have a relationship with them
you don't even have to be good at conversation
I'm not "good" at conversation
I just like to talk
about
things
and listen to stories
and hear people's perspectives(edited)
and that's why people liek to talk to me
because I will listen to whatever they want to ramble on about
again, just food for thought
I'm just making aware of what your actions are telling me and what the consequences of them are
you can choose to do what u wish with that information
and there's no "right" or "wrong" thing
people are like functions
u put in x and u get y
put in a, get b
every time
i use math analogy cus u have math boner
or something
xd

A Random Badger - Today at 12:41 AM
it is a paradox for me, either i spend more time talking to people to build relationships that i wont necessarily even be comfortable with because i distrust the intentions of everyone around me while also regretting my decision to talk to people when i could be spending that tie by myself and trying to enjoy myself OR i can spend more time doing things i want to by myself wishing i friends, that i trusted the intentions of, to talk to about things and play similar games with but at least on this flip side of the coin i can at least numb my brain and the pain and enjoy myself in at least a little bit by playing the game i want to because at least i can trust that the intention of game is never to harm me, thus i lean towards this side of the coin

fancy - Today at 12:42 AM
I understand
I have lived through the same paradox
but it's still my responsibility to make u aware of what's going on
I invite you to consider what each person has done specifically to earn your distrust
just as a thought exercise
when u have nothing better to do
it doesn't solve the problem but it helps

A Random Badger - Today at 12:44 AM
id rather not, it'll just prevent me my sleep for tonight and i can assure myself i will find something whether it is logical or just based on anxiey i will not know but it will not matter to my brain and heart

fancy - Today at 12:45 AM
you have to confront things at some point
and I didn't say it has to be tonight
there is lots of time
