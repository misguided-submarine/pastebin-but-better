[Yesterday, 2:42 PM]  tyler:  	HAHEHHEHEEHEHE  	HEHEHEGZAH  	oo i ...

[12:58 AM] A Random Badger: also this could be entirely made up
[12:58 AM] A Random Badger: so
[12:58 AM] A Random Badger: idk
[12:58 AM] A Random Badger: lmao
[12:58 AM] A Random Badger: im curious
[1:00 AM] fancy: what am I looking at
[1:01 AM] A Random Badger: messages between nikki and tyler supposedly
[1:01 AM] A Random Badger: of nikki treating tyler like shit
[1:01 AM] A Random Badger: allegedly
[1:01 AM] A Random Badger: and im curious as to whether
[1:02 AM] A Random Badger: this is fake or like there's more to it and her response is like completely justified
[1:02 AM] fancy: did Tyler send you this?
[1:02 AM] A Random Badger: or if
[1:02 AM] A Random Badger: she's actually just a bitch
[1:02 AM] A Random Badger: yes
[1:02 AM] A Random Badger: and pizza
[1:02 AM] fancy: I'm curious why it matters
[1:02 AM] A Random Badger: well it doesnt really matter much to me
[1:03 AM] A Random Badger: im more or elss curious as to whether or not
[1:03 AM] A Random Badger: like i said
[1:03 AM] fancy: except here you are asking about it
[1:03 AM] fancy: lol
[1:03 AM] A Random Badger: tyler is just being sneaky
[1:03 AM] A Random Badger: and dumb
[1:03 AM] A Random Badger: or
[1:03 AM] A Random Badger: if nikki is huge bitch
[1:03 AM] fancy: she's a woman, isn't your default that she's a bitch
[1:04 AM] A Random Badger: and if nikki is huge bitch then i care slightly more cause then i feel in a way like im validated xd
[1:04 AM] fancy: you're not validated I'll just tell you that lol
[1:05 AM] A Random Badger: well i am in the sense that, im right about her not just being this perfect little princess i feel like you portray her as if she is just a huge bitch towards tyler for no reason other than she's toxic scum
1:05 AM] fancy: I dont think I've ever said she's a perfect princess lol wtf
[1:05 AM] A Random Badger: my words not yours lol
[1:06 AM] A Random Badger: thats just how i feel like you portray her
[1:06 AM] A Random Badger: as this being that can't do any wrong
[1:06 AM] A Random Badger: personally
[1:06 AM] fancy: I mean I take no responsibility for your interpretation of reality
[1:07 AM] A Random Badger: so anyways do you know about any of this? like is this just a load of bs from tyler? xd
[1:07 AM] A Random Badger: cause i also dont care for tyler
[1:07 AM] A Random Badger: so idc which outcome it is
[1:07 AM] A Random Badger: tbh
[1:07 AM] fancy: almost everything that comes out of Tyler is motivated by perhaps a real feeling and then coloured by a large amount of personal bias and general teenaged bullshit
[1:07 AM] fancy: with a good dose of not being very smart thrown in
[1:08 AM] fancy: he broke a promise
[1:08 AM] fancy: and I trust nikki's judgment
[1:09 AM] A Random Badger: im guessing you just asked her rq lol
[1:09 AM] A Random Badger: i see tho
[1:09 AM] fancy: why would you think that lol
[1:09 AM] A Random Badger: based on what seemed like a break in thought
[1:09 AM] fancy: there's no break in thought there
[1:10 AM] A Random Badger: the line "he broke a promise" seemed sudden
[1:10 AM] fancy: you asked if it's a load of bullshit
[1:10 AM] fancy: I said most of what he says is bullshit that got twisted from reality
[1:10 AM] A Random Badger: yes lol
[1:10 AM] fancy: she told me he broke a promise to her and I trust her
[1:10 AM] fancy: that's what I know
[1:10 AM] A Random Badger: okay gotcha
[1:10 AM] fancy: he does this to himself and plays victim
[1:10 AM] fancy: it happens over and over
[1:11 AM] A Random Badger: oh so this happens frequently?
[1:11 AM] fancy: the pattern of playing victim?
[1:11 AM] fancy: yeah he's a teenager
[1:11 AM] fancy: he's dumb like the rest
[1:12 AM] A Random Badger: no i meant these kinds of altercations
[1:12 AM] A Random Badger: but yea i gotcha
[1:12 AM] A Random Badger: that makes sense tho reading through this
[1:12 AM] A Random Badger: that he broke a promise
[1:12 AM] fancy: he and Nikki fight a lot, I don't know why she put up with him, but I trust her to make her own choices
[1:12 AM] A Random Badger: aren't they dating or smth
[1:13 AM] fancy: but he always plays victim and never takes personal responsibility for anything as far as I can tell
[1:13 AM] fancy: so history repeats itself
[1:13 AM] fancy: that's not a question I can answer I don't think
[1:13 AM] A Random Badger: well i mean i think i know the answer cause apparently tyler told pizza they are dating
[1:13 AM] A Random Badger: but idk if thats also
[1:13 AM] A Random Badger: bs from tyler
[1:13 AM] A Random Badger: lol
[1:14 AM] A Random Badger: but this definitely sounds like
[1:14 AM] A Random Badger: classic mad gf
[1:14 AM] A Random Badger: reaction to breaking a promise
[1:14 AM] A Random Badger: so it all makes sense to me now i think
[1:14 AM] fancy: sounds like classic normal human being reaction to breaking a promise
1:14 AM] A Random Badger: especially if he constantly does this stuff
[1:14 AM] A Random Badger: well idk if the classic normal human reaction is
[1:15 AM] fancy: to be angry?
[1:15 AM] A Random Badger: quite as aggressive
[1:15 AM] A Random Badger: depending on the promise
[1:15 AM] fancy: your reaction to animals being animals is to want to kill them
[1:15 AM] fancy: soooo
[1:15 AM] A Random Badger: but definitely this aggressive if it's repeated behavior
[1:15 AM] A Random Badger: wat
[1:15 AM] A Random Badger: no thats you
[1:15 AM] A Random Badger: with my chickens
[1:15 AM] A Random Badger: rude man
[1:16 AM] A Random Badger: you're the one who just wants to kill and eat all the animals
[1:16 AM] A Random Badger: xd
[1:16 AM] A Random Badger: but yea idk what the promise was
[1:16 AM] A Random Badger: so
[1:16 AM] A Random Badger: but thinking back to the time when
[1:16 AM] A Random Badger: you got betrayed by hope and that whole group
[1:16 AM] A Random Badger: when you got treated like shit
[1:16 AM] A Random Badger: even you didnt react so aggressively
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: so thats where im making the comparison
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: but also
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: as i said
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: if this is repeated behavior from him
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: then that is definitely the type of reaction i would expect
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: is what im saying
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: lol
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: but okay
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: i see now
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: my curiosity
[1:18 AM] A Random Badger: has been satiated
[1:18 AM] A Random Badger: ty
[1:18 AM] fancy: no you wanted to kill a dog but instead you punched a fence
[1:18 AM] fancy: i don't want to eat animals out of anger
[1:18 AM] fancy: I want to eat them because they are delicious
[1:18 AM] A Random Badger: oh you're tlaking about that
[1:18 AM] fancy: I didn't react aggressively because I wasn't mad I was broken
[1:19 AM] A Random Badger: well tbf, it was someone else's dog who had no control over it that did damage to our property and killed some of our animals
[1:19 AM] A Random Badger: so yea i wanted to kill it
[1:19 AM] A Random Badger: lol
[1:19 AM] fancy: you're just rationalizing it now
[1:19 AM] fancy: lol
[1:19 AM] fancy: I'm just pointing out
[1:19 AM] fancy: you had a more aggressive reaction to anger
[1:19 AM] A Random Badger: yea i get it now
[1:19 AM] A Random Badger: but anyways
[1:19 AM] fancy: everyone is different
