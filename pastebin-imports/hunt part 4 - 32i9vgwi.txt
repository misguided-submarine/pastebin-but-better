[00:47 AM] A Random Badger: yes
[00:47 AM] fancy: alright
[00:47 AM] fancy: so
[00:48 AM] fancy: this is what I mean by an out of game advantage
[00:48 AM] fancy: or an advantage you can accrue
[00:48 AM] fancy: granted, there is always the possibility of the less equipped team upsetting the better equipped team
[00:48 AM] fancy: by out playing or by a myriad of factors
[00:48 AM] A Random Badger: this is the thing tho
[00:48 AM] fancy: that's how teams that are behind in dota win team fights
[00:48 AM] fancy: for example
[00:48 AM] A Random Badger: i think you massively underestimate that possibility
[00:49 AM] fancy: it doesn't matter how possible it is
[00:49 AM] fancy: for me at least
[00:49 AM] A Random Badger: i wouldn't even just call it a posibility
[00:49 AM] A Random Badger: i would call it very likely
[00:49 AM] fancy: even if it's a small advantage
[00:49 AM] fancy: it's still an advantage
[00:49 AM] fancy: yeah?
[00:49 AM] fancy: and that kind of consistent character progression really doesn't sit well with me
[00:49 AM] fancy: in a pvp oriented game
[00:49 AM] fancy: so even tho this is pve and pvp
[00:50 AM] fancy: it really bothers me that you can grind out somewhat of an advantage
[00:50 AM] fancy: just by playing beforehand
[00:50 AM] fancy: and that was kinda the whole thing I was trying to understand in the first place
[00:50 AM] fancy: I have nothing against the game and I'm sure it's a very good game
[00:50 AM] fancy: just like wow is a good game
[00:50 AM] fancy: but that kind of thing I don't find appealing to play and tha'ts kinda what i was trying to figure out
[00:50 AM] fancy: if I would have any interest in buying it
[00:51 AM] fancy: since you originally brought it up in that context
[00:51 AM] fancy: so I'm fine talking about the game generally now that I understand that
[00:51 AM] A Random Badger: but i find that to be a rather ignorant stance tbh
[00:51 AM] fancy: how is that ignorate
[00:51 AM] fancy: that's just not a thing I enjoy
[00:51 AM] fancy: do you enjoy dota
[00:51 AM] fancy: ?
[00:52 AM] A Random Badger: because i think that just completely devalues and ignores things that could balance that out
[00:52 AM] A Random Badger: its like saying
[00:52 AM] fancy: I'm sure lots of people don't mind it and think it's okay and balanced
[00:52 AM] A Random Badger: so and so spice has a strong taste and i wil never have it on anything even if its flavor and intensity is balanced out by another spice
[00:53 AM] fancy: it's not really like that at all
[00:53 AM] fancy: beacuse in a strictly pve game
[00:53 AM] fancy: I'm okay with this progression
[00:53 AM] fancy: but I'm 100% not okay wiht any game that pits players against each other
[00:53 AM] fancy: not being the exact same experience for everyone in every game
[00:53 AM] fancy: if that makes sense
[00:53 AM] fancy: in dota, everyone starts at level 1 with 600 gold
[00:53 AM] fancy: if someone was able tos tart with like
[00:53 AM] fancy: 620
[00:54 AM] fancy: I would be very upset
[00:54 AM] fancy: even though that's super minor
[00:54 AM] fancy: in the grand scheme of things
[00:54 AM] fancy: because the way I enjoy games is 100% a test of skills
[00:54 AM] fancy: I dont' want other variables
[00:54 AM] A Random Badger: even if such hero had an equally effective debuff of some sort so to speak?
[00:54 AM] fancy: okay so
[00:54 AM] fancy: this would only be analogous
[00:54 AM] fancy: if buying better gear made your character weaker in some way
[00:55 AM] fancy: or if upgrading your health made you weaker
[00:55 AM] fancy: is that true?
[00:55 AM] fancy: another way to put this is
[00:55 AM] fancy: if you had a choice between goiqng into the game with a maxed out character
[00:55 AM] fancy: vs a new one
[00:55 AM] fancy: which one would you choose
[00:56 AM] A Random Badger: well i would go with a new one because i enjoy the ability to progress my character but thats a personal preference, even if i had a maxed character i would just keep hm as an achievement so to speak
[00:56 AM] fancy: okay if your only goal was to win
[00:56 AM] fancy: which would you choose
[00:57 AM] A Random Badger: fine w.e
[00:57 AM] fancy: keep in mind I'm asking from my perspective
[00:57 AM] fancy: because the only thing i care about in a game is winning
[00:57 AM] fancy: I'm sure there's like 102310-238123 other ways to enjoy games
[00:57 AM] fancy: but they don't really count for me, yeah?
[00:58 AM] fancy: so I'm not pronouncing judgment(edited)
[00:58 AM] A Random Badger: then i dont think you even need to know about even the "out of game advantage" to determine that
[00:58 AM] fancy: elaborate?(edited)
[00:58 AM] fancy: oh shit the crysis people made this game
[00:58 AM] A Random Badger: because you could equally come to the conclusion that its not worth playing if the games is just as much about survival as it is winning which it is
[00:59 AM] fancy: I mean not really
[00:59 AM] A Random Badger: yes
[00:59 AM] fancy: survival is like
[00:59 AM] fancy: can be a subobjective
[00:59 AM] A Random Badger: because i dont think you understand that
[00:59 AM] fancy: where you have to balance that with winning
[00:59 AM] A Random Badger: if you found yourself playing this game
[01:00 AM] fancy: actually I thought of a better way to talk about this but finish your thought
[01:00 AM] A Random Badger: you would be forced into so many positions that would require you to weight the risk of continueing to try to "win" lets say if you just finished a costly fight with another team or group of ai, against leaving extrating early with what you have and try next time
[01:00 AM] A Random Badger: because thats what the game is about
[01:00 AM] A Random Badger: its not just about the bounty
[01:00 AM] fancy: okay right
[01:01 AM] fancy: I can understand that
[01:01 AM] fancy: so
[01:01 AM] fancy: then I would ask
[01:01 AM] fancy: what motivates that objective
[01:01 AM] A Random Badger: purely money
[01:01 AM] fancy: exactly
[01:01 AM] fancy: which is a form of out of game progression
[01:01 AM] A Random Badger: but this is why i tried to explain to you the form of 2 different progression paths
[01:01 AM] A Random Badger: money
[01:01 AM] fancy: which is what i have a problem with because it fucks with the game at its core
[01:01 AM] A Random Badger: and exp
[01:01 AM] fancy: it would be like in dota
[01:01 AM] fancy: if you could like
[01:02 AM] fancy: escape
[01:02 AM] fancy: with your hero
[01:02 AM] fancy: alive
[01:02 AM] fancy: and use him next game
[01:02 AM] fancy: like I'm sure you can build a balanced game around that
[01:02 AM] fancy: but to me it's already degenerated so far at that point
[01:02 AM] fancy: that I have a lot of questions
[01:02 AM] A Random Badger: but your comparing a game where you actually lose vs a game where you only lose if you die,
[01:02 AM] A Random Badger: in dota if you dont win
[01:02 AM] A Random Badger: you lose
[01:02 AM] A Random Badger: in hunt if you dont win, you didnt lose, you only lose if you die
[01:02 AM] fancy: so then you're just describing like
[01:02 AM] fancy: an rpg
[01:02 AM] fancy: or something
[01:03 AM] fancy: some like mmo-esque thing
[01:03 AM] fancy: wher eyou have permadeath
[01:03 AM] fancy: or like terraria
[01:03 AM] fancy: where if you die you have to reroll
[01:03 AM] fancy: and that I think also kinda makes for a bad game
[01:03 AM] fancy: at least for me
[01:03 AM] A Random Badger: thats my point
[01:03 AM] fancy: but that's all tied to out of game progression
[01:03 AM] fancy: all those games have out of game progression more or less
[01:04 AM] fancy: what's the word
[01:04 AM] fancy: their characters are like
[01:04 AM] fancy: persistant
[01:04 AM] fancy: yeah that
[01:05 AM] fancy: and I didn't know that's how this game worked
[01:05 AM] fancy: which is what prompted me to ask
[01:05 AM] fancy: way back
[01:05 AM] fancy: at the beginning
[01:06 AM] A Random Badger: idk i dont see the point in continuing conversation over a game that doesnt and wouldnt interest you then and to me like thats a waste of time because these are things you could've figured out on your own instead you have me in this practical battle to convince you that its even worth talking about which it isnt at this rate and i honestly feel like this was truly a waste of time because i gained nothing from this conversation and you gained the information you could've simply sought out on google rq and then i wouldn't have to struggle to hold a conversation about something with someone who doesnt care
[01:07 AM] A Random Badger: and thats the thing that bothers me
[01:07 AM] fancy: okay so
[01:07 AM] A Random Badger: more than not being about to lead a conversation in discord
[01:07 AM] fancy: I will still
[01:07 AM] fancy: talk about the game
[01:07 AM] fancy: but I asked a pretty simple question
[01:07 AM] fancy: about something
[01:07 AM] fancy: and you kinda failed to answer it
[01:07 AM] fancy: if you had just said "yes"
[01:07 AM] fancy: then you could have gone on to explain how the game worked
[01:07 AM] fancy: and i owuld have listened
[01:08 AM] fancy: I never said it's not worth talking about lol
[01:08 AM] fancy: I talk abotu a lot of games I dont' play
[01:08 AM] fancy: like sc or smash(edited)
[01:08 AM] fancy: the problem I'm seeing is you went into this with an agenda that I don't really understand what it even was
[01:08 AM] fancy: and some how that wasn't fulfilled?
[01:08 AM] fancy: like what did you think you were gonna gain
[01:08 AM] A Random Badger: thats not how i think it works because as soon as your question is satisfied there is nothing tieing to continuing the conversation because there is nothing more for me to talk about if people dont show interest
[01:09 AM] fancy: and how do I give that to you
[01:09 AM] fancy: ?
[01:09 AM] fancy: what
[01:09 AM] fancy: badger you are being
[01:09 AM] fancy: super uncharitable
[01:09 AM] fancy: toward everyone
[01:09 AM] fancy: I'd 100% still talk about the game
[01:09 AM] fancy: if you wanted to
[01:09 AM] fancy: I just dont' want to play it
[01:09 AM] fancy: you can still tell me stories about your success(edited)
[01:09 AM] fancy: or failure
[01:09 AM] fancy: or whatever other memes you want
[01:09 AM] A Random Badger: sure
[01:10 AM] A Random Badger: but theres no point explaining a game to people who arent going to play it bc it doesnt interest them
[01:10 AM] fancy: why not
[01:10 AM] fancy: not everything is strictly utilitarian
[01:10 AM] fancy: I'm not opposed to talking about things i don't play
[01:10 AM] fancy: I talk about things that don't really apply to me directly all the time
[01:10 AM] fancy: you're the only one putting this arbitrary limitation on things
[01:11 AM] fancy: and I don't really get why
[01:11 AM] A Random Badger: the reason is simply because my mind is very railroaded, my mind is limited when it comes to conversation, and as soon as it turns into something else then i no longer have any way to contribute
[01:12 AM] fancy: that's purely on your end tho
[01:12 AM] fancy: like you have to accept that this isn't anyone else doing this to you
[01:12 AM] fancy: and you could still have a conversation if you got over that
[01:12 AM] A Random Badger: i never said that it was that way
[01:12 AM] fancy: that just sounds like such a cop out
[01:12 AM] fancy: especially when you turn around and say things like
[01:13 AM] A Random Badger: but i dont see the point in carrying on a conversation no one shows interest in and i dont think you really understand that point of view
[01:13 AM] fancy: "oh no one ever wants to have conversations with me or they don't reach out to me"
[01:13 AM] fancy: yeah?
[01:13 AM] fancy: because you are mistaking
[01:13 AM] fancy: not wanting to play
[01:13 AM] fancy: with not having any interest
[01:13 AM] fancy: you're being extremely uncharitable towards my position
[01:13 AM] fancy: and assuming a lot of things
[01:13 AM] A Random Badger: no thats not the part where it goes wrong
[01:14 AM] A Random Badger: the part as that as soon as question gets satisfied theres nothing else to bring up
[01:14 AM] fancy: not really
[01:14 AM] fancy: I would keep asking questions if you kept talking
[01:14 AM] A Random Badger: but i owuld have no point to
[01:14 AM] fancy: I don't know why you think I'll just dismiss you when I'm done
[01:14 AM] A Random Badger: because i would have no idea of whether ot not anyone was interested
[01:14 AM] fancy: if i'm still participating
[01:14 AM] fancy: I'm interested
[01:14 AM] fancy: lol what
[01:14 AM] fancy: ????
[01:15 AM] A Random Badger: im saying
[01:15 AM] A Random Badger: if i just answered your questio
[01:15 AM] A Random Badger: and you were like
[01:15 AM] A Random Badger: okaay
[01:15 AM] A Random Badger: and that was it
[01:15 AM] A Random Badger: i'd be like
[01:15 AM] A Random Badger: ok
[01:15 AM] A Random Badger: conversation over ig
[01:15 AM] fancy: I mean if you had nothing else to say
[01:15 AM] A Random Badger: because at that point im not longer sensing interest from anyone
[01:15 AM] fancy: then yeah I couldn't really talk to you about it
[01:16 AM] fancy: but if you kept talking about it
[01:16 AM] A Random Badger: its not even not having stuff to say
[01:16 AM] fancy: I can keep talking with you
[01:16 AM] A Random Badger: its that
[01:16 AM] A Random Badger: i ahve this point of view where
