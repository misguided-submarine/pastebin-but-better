here i'll try to articulate my response
the crux of it is that you can't really understnad what it's like being a minority and a different skin color
I'd say the only way you could really understand it is if you lived in a community in which everything you did, you were the minority
like say you lived in a town that's 94% black and latino or something

and im saying being a local minority has nothing to do with it rather the actual location and the social attitudes of people that live there
blacks are a minority here
but i can almost guarantee they suffer a vast amount less discrimination here than they would in say chicago
because people here are more well behaved and respectable
and dont really care about your skin color
or your ethnicity
people in a place like chicago
i think its chicago im thinking of
thats all run down
i might be mistaken
for another city

As I said, you're totally wrong about this, and you can't really understand how ubiquitous racism is, even in the best of communities
When you're a different skin color, almost everything is different
People immediately make an assumption about you
and this applies everywhere
we live in a really nice neighborhood now
A Random Badger - Today at 6:02 PM
but the same can be said thats just an assumption based off your experiences
pizza - Today at 6:03 PM
and almost everyone we've talked to, even though indiana is FAR better than oklahoma, even though people are super nice here, people just assume that my parents are doctors because there's nothign else that can be done
let me finish.
It applies to literally everything. I have my own stories, I have my parents stories. I personally have lived in three distinct places and have experiences from them all
I lived in canada, oklahoma, and indiana, so i have a way more diverse experience than average
and my parents have even more diverse experiences than me, since they also were in dubai, qatar, and other places before I even existed
and I have stories from them
anyways, you'll be surprised how ubiquitous it is
simple things
small things
like we'll all go to a burger joint
i'll be with my buddies
and my two buddies will go infront of me and
order a burger combo and ask for some cheese on their fries, which is extra
and the waiter's like yeah sure!
and then i go and order the exact same thing and sometimes, not every time obviously, but sometimes i'll get a "are you sure? it's a dollar extra!"
he/she won't ask anyone else, but they'll ask me because their presumption is that i'm cheap, or that i can't afford it
and this has happened to me multiple times, and it's happened to my dad a lot
my dad was a sales manager at a company called hilti, which is a swiss based company
anways, he was in canada, and he was part of a meeting
over dinner
and one of the guys straight up asks
"hey why is our driver sitting here at the same dinner table"
assumingt hat because he's indian, he coudln't be in a corporate job
or that there's no way that he's a manager
and like, some of my experiences can be written off as anecdotal
like, peopel in middle school called me a terrorist and would make jokes about how my parents plotted 9/11 just because i'm brown
even though, you know, indians aren't terrorists, and are more against muslims and pakistan and the middle east than americans ever have been
besides the point though
like that can be seen as anecdotal, because it's very specific to my color
but it's still relevant
A Random Badger - Today at 6:09 PM
tho this is where i would ask
if i may
pizza - Today at 6:09 PM
sure
it's still in the simplest things possible
people won't hold the door for you
they'll like, make eye contact with you as they're holding the door, and then let go because thye realize you're brown
A Random Badger - Today at 6:10 PM
isnt there a diference between harmful discrimination such as how you were treated as being like a terrorist in school and more or less just a rude racially biased comment that isnt quite as harmful even though surely hurtful
pizza - Today at 6:10 PM
well the terrorist shit is less harmful even
because it had no consequences
but some other things do
simple things like people not holding the door after seeing what i look like
i was at a restaurant once (after telling my dad this story he told me how he had the same experience with someone else)
but all four of my buddies order large icecream
and it's super clear
no confusion
they allg et larges
and i get a small
and i'm like
hey i asked for a large
and the person's like "yeah but that's more expensive, are you sure?"
and i'm like ......yeah!! and she's just liek okaaaaay if you want
anyways, that's two restaurant examples
but even in customer service
restaurants is such a good example because it's the most common place you encounter random people who are supposed to serve you
we'll be seated and then not served for so long
or intentionally put in a corner
even when it's wide open
and hardly anyone is there
like, i'm not saying that a white person can't go through these experiences if they were the minority
i'm not saying that because of your skin color you get treated differently necessarily in a closed community
i'm saying that being a minority skin color leads to these kinds of things
and it's something that you can't actually understand
