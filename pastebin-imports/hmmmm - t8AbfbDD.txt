2:40 AM] pizza: you think you're right but not sure if you think that because you have sufficient evidence or simply because you were right before
[2:40 AM] pizza: yeah you do that a lot lol
[2:40 AM] fancy: wat
[2:40 AM] fancy: u can't possibly know
[2:40 AM] fancy: whatehr I'm right or now
[2:40 AM] fancy: not
[2:41 AM] fancy: lol
[2:41 AM] pizza: idk fam sometimes you walk through meatball when you coulda done other things
[2:41 AM] fancy: YEAH I COULD ALSO HAVE STRENGTH MORPHED
[2:41 AM] fancy: BUT I DIDN'T
[2:41 AM] pizza: what i'm trying to say is
[2:41 AM] pizza: i feel like that happens a lot
[2:41 AM] pizza: i specifically remember once
[2:41 AM] fancy: if I str morph I can walk away and I'm fine but I didn't
[2:41 AM] fancy: and that's just life sometimes
[2:41 AM] pizza: i watched you play storm
[2:41 AM] pizza: and you died right after getting bloodstone
[2:41 AM] pizza: and then respawned
[2:42 AM] pizza: and zapped back onto the drow + 1 that was showing
[2:42 AM] pizza: and died again
[2:42 AM] pizza: and i was like
[2:42 AM] pizza: oof why did you go in on drow + 1
[2:42 AM] pizza: like it was clearly not the play
[2:42 AM] pizza: hbut you were like "that wasn't my play"
[2:42 AM] fancy: it wasn't
[2:42 AM] pizza: and i'm like what do you mean
[2:42 AM] fancy: i remeber this
[2:42 AM] fancy: my play was popping haste rune
[2:42 AM] pizza: and you're just liek "it wasn't MY  PLAY"
[2:42 AM] fancy: and not dying in the first place
[2:42 AM] fancy: that was my play
[2:42 AM] fancy: I just didn't do that cus
[2:42 AM] pizza: yeah  but the dying hte second time
[2:42 AM] fancy: bad mechanics
[2:42 AM] fancy: idk I thought they would die
[2:42 AM] fancy: or something
[2:42 AM] pizza: after haste rune was already consumed
[2:43 AM] pizza: well yeah buy tlike
[2:43 AM] pizza: instead of being liek "yeah that was some oof, going in and dying a second time"
[2:43 AM] fancy: cus i wasn't talking about that
[2:43 AM] fancy: wasn't that obvious
[2:43 AM] pizza: you were just like "yeah b ut no that wasn't my play"
[2:43 AM] pizza: yeah but i was very clearly talking about second zap
[2:43 AM] pizza: first one was unfortunate
[2:43 AM] fancy: uh
[2:43 AM] fancy: no
[2:43 AM] fancy: i didn't get that
[2:43 AM] fancy: lol
[2:43 AM] pizza: idk this is just an example
[2:43 AM] fancy: cus I was in the middle of playing
[2:43 AM] fancy: lmfao
[2:44 AM] fancy: I don't see how
[2:44 AM] fancy: either of us were wron ghere
[2:44 AM] fancy: we were just talking about different things
[2:44 AM] fancy: the bigger problem for me there is
[2:44 AM] pizza: i still am finding that hard to believe when I specifically said that there was no reason for you to go in a second time nad die
[2:44 AM] fancy: the thing that steel made that video about
[2:44 AM] fancy: and trying to do much
[2:44 AM] fancy: to compensate for everyone else doing nothing
[2:45 AM] fancy: I mean if you said that
[2:45 AM] fancy: then I missed it
[2:45 AM] fancy: cus that was not the impression I had
[2:45 AM] pizza: but this is just like one example
[2:45 AM] fancy: okay
[2:45 AM] fancy: so
[2:45 AM] fancy: try again lol
[2:45 AM] pizza: one that stood out because it seemed so absurd
[2:45 AM] fancy: I mean yeah
[2:45 AM] fancy: we weren't talking about the same thing
[2:46 AM] fancy: so of course it seems absurd
[2:46 AM] fancy: I have a hard time holding conversations while playing
[2:46 AM] fancy: that's been true forever
2:50 AM] pizza: the only thing this changes
[2:50 AM] pizza: is that now i know that at least you have doubts sometimes
[2:50 AM] fancy: I mean
[2:50 AM] pizza: because the way you play it
[2:50 AM] fancy: I have doubts all the time
[2:50 AM] fancy: this is something that very much bothers me
[2:50 AM] pizza: you always seem like you think you know everyhting 100%^ of the time lol
[2:50 AM] fancy: I mean
[2:50 AM] fancy: I also spend
[2:50 AM] fancy: WAY TOO MUCH fucking time
[2:50 AM] fancy: thinkign about things
[2:50 AM] fancy: and if I'm right about htem
[2:51 AM] fancy: or how to be right about them
[2:51 AM] fancy: so yeah when I talk about things I'm generally pretty convinced
[2:51 AM] fancy: because i know why I think what I think
[2:51 AM] fancy: and I still feel like a lot of the time
[2:51 AM] fancy: other ppl
[2:51 AM] fancy: don't do that
[2:51 AM] fancy: at all
[2:52 AM] fancy: like even the meepo thing
[2:52 AM] fancy: u kinda just
[2:52 AM] fancy: spit out a bunch of reasons that I don't think were really that good
[2:52 AM] fancy: and u didn't really respond to the things I said
[2:52 AM] pizza: idk if i even wanna touch that
[2:52 AM] fancy: and then I figured out better reasons
[2:52 AM] fancy: without u
[2:52 AM] fancy: and idk why you didn't just use those
[2:53 AM] pizza: because implying that you're right also implies that icefrog nerfed twice for no good reason, that he had a 67% winrate simply because his counters weren't figured out, and pros complaining about him being op were also wrong
[2:53 AM] fancy: what
[2:53 AM] pizza: like okay the reasons i brought up to the conversation were perhaps not the most important
[2:53 AM] fancy: just because I was wrong doesn't make ur reasons correct
[2:53 AM] fancy: you were just like "HE GOOD" and I'm like why wat(edited)
[2:53 AM] fancy: and then everything us aid
[2:53 AM] pizza: no
[2:53 AM] pizza: you were like
[2:53 AM] fancy: didn't make sense
[2:53 AM] pizza: what no
[2:53 AM] fancy: yeah I was like
[2:53 AM] fancy: I disagree
[2:53 AM] fancy: cus like
[2:53 AM] pizza: you very clearly felt he wasn't op
[2:53 AM] fancy: why would I think differently
[2:53 AM] fancy: I hadn't played
[2:53 AM] fancy: the patch
[2:53 AM] fancy: except like 1 game
[2:53 AM] fancy: and I didn't play meepo
[2:54 AM] fancy: but looking at the changes
[2:54 AM] fancy: I had an opinion
[2:54 AM] fancy: and nothing u said changed that
[2:54 AM] fancy: so clearly u were missing something
[2:54 AM] fancy: like sure he has 67% winrate
[2:54 AM] fancy: but based on what I know
[2:54 AM] fancy: the only reasons that coudl be
[2:54 AM] fancy: are cus he owns the current buffed heroes
[2:54 AM] fancy: cus I didn't think about things like
[2:54 AM] fancy: wraith bands being
[2:54 AM] fancy: extera stupid
[2:54 AM] fancy: or treads getting 2 more stats is actually4  more stats for free
[2:55 AM] fancy: or cleave being destroyed
[2:55 AM] fancy: like yeah ransack is good I guess but geostrike was better I'm like 100% sure of this
[2:55 AM] fancy: I don't think that 60 hp/s healing is what make or breaks that hero
[2:56 AM] fancy: I think everything else about him getting indirectly buffed is a good reason for him being good
[2:56 AM] pizza: I still I disagree with that even. I think that if you changed nothing about this patch other than replacing ransack with geostrike, he'd be weaker
[2:56 AM] fancy: u underestimate
[2:56 AM] fancy: how powerful geostrike is
[2:56 AM] pizza: and it's only 60hp/s if he attacks only 1/sec
[2:56 AM] fancy: it went through bkb
[2:56 AM] fancy: and worked on rosh
[2:57 AM] fancy: you'd have to show that it lets him man up on things he couldn't man up on before
[2:57 AM] pizza: still does pure damage, and overall damage to heroes wasn't that lessened simply because geostrike was reapplying the dot, not letting it run its course for m ax damage and then reapplying
[2:57 AM] fancy: it was until you attack more than 2x per second basically
[2:57 AM] fancy: and geostrike also slowed through bkb
[2:57 AM] fancy: geostrike was so strong
[2:58 AM] pizza: I still refuse to believe that, with the only direct balance change to meepo being a supposed nerf to his passive, his winrate went up 17% only because of external changes to the game
[2:58 AM] pizza: that's absurd
2:58 AM] fancy: nets cancel tp
[2:58 AM] fancy: wraith band op
[2:58 AM] fancy: treads buffed
[2:58 AM] fancy: phase buffed
[2:58 AM] fancy: meta heroes suck agaisnt meepo
[2:58 AM] fancy: meepo spammers are the majority of meepo players
[2:58 AM] fancy: I think all those are valid reasons he can spike in winrate
[3:02 AM] fancy: idk from my perspective it was just another instance of someone making an assertion and then being unable to back it up
[3:03 AM] pizza: yeah
[3:05 AM] pizza: I think what bothered me more than anything was you brushing off the winrate. Even in a world where geostrike is better than ransack overall, a 67% winrate is a clear indication that something is terribly wrong with the balance of the hero, and even if that problem has something to do with external changes, it's still something that has to be addressed, and can't be just allowed to continue
[3:05 AM] pizza: meepo needed the nerfs to at least bring his winrate to a more acceptable place
[3:05 AM] fancy: sure maybe
[3:05 AM] fancy: but
[3:05 AM] fancy: I also don't believe
[3:05 AM] fancy: in 1 day worth of data
[3:05 AM] fancy: being that significant
[3:05 AM] fancy: if he had 67% over a week sure
[3:05 AM] fancy: but like
[3:05 AM] pizza: I think it's just reading from history too, that kind of spike has literally never happened.
[3:05 AM] fancy: less than 24 hours
[3:06 AM] pizza: except for when centaur came out in 2012
[3:06 AM] pizza: and that hero was universally accepted as op as shit
[3:06 AM] fancy: yeah but didn't
[3:06 AM] fancy: he stay
[3:06 AM] fancy: at 65%
[3:06 AM] fancy: for aw hile
[3:06 AM] fancy: before they changed him
[3:06 AM] fancy: this was a VERY fast follow up it was like less than 24 hours I think that was rather silly
[3:06 AM] pizza: game still in beta back then
[3:06 AM] pizza: but like
[3:06 AM] pizza: imagine if you only had one hour of data(edited)
[3:06 AM] pizza: aka like 10k games
[3:06 AM] pizza: but the hero won all 10k games
[3:07 AM] pizza: that's still pretty fucking significant
[3:07 AM] pizza: even if it's only one hour of *data
[3:07 AM] pizza: in that case, you wouldn't need a week of data to realize that something is really fucking wrong
[3:07 AM] pizza: and i know that's a stretch
[3:07 AM] fancy: sure but now we're just arguing over where the arbitrary line is
[3:07 AM] pizza: but 67% is also fucking obscene
[3:08 AM] fancy: it's really high yeah
[3:09 AM] fancy: heroes have also had like 70% winrates "this week" because it's monday and stats just started over
[3:09 AM] fancy: and reddit is like WAH LOOK OP
[3:09 AM] fancy: and then everyone is like
[3:09 AM] fancy: IT'S MONDAY U MORON
[3:09 AM] fancy: or wahtever
[3:09 AM] fancy: and then it levels out
[3:09 AM] fancy: that's a thing that has happened a lot
[3:09 AM] pizza: i guess i've never noticed that
