1:58 PM] pizza: @Raccoon Friend btw that zoe had 4.3k hours
[2:02 PM] Raccoon Friend: makes sense
[2:02 PM] Raccoon Friend: I'm sorry for getting salty and just giving up
[2:02 PM] pizza: ye it's fine i guess
[2:03 PM] pizza: when you get in that state, it's hard to talk about anything with you really lol
[2:03 PM] Raccoon Friend: what can I say
[2:03 PM] Raccoon Friend: im an asshole
[2:03 PM] pizza: like, you asked a simple question about why it's not the best idea going for the best player by yourself as a tank and i tried to explain but you just became so caustic and were like "well fuck you i didn't care"
[2:05 PM] pizza: He has over 4k hours
[2:05 PM] pizza: and if fancy or I were tank and chased him we'd have also got dunked on
[2:07 PM] Raccoon Friend: again
[2:07 PM] Raccoon Friend: im an asshole
[2:07 PM] pizza: which is still something you can work on
[2:07 PM] pizza: if you write it off, then nothing will improve. it's like how josh used to write off being sad and being depressed with who he is as a person
[2:07 PM] pizza: and he wrote it off as something he couldn't control
[2:08 PM] pizza: and how it was just who he was and that's why he's sad and depressed or whatever
[2:08 PM] pizza: and once he realized he was in control of that and started actively working on it simply by being a bit more aware of how he reacts to things, he's no longer that depressed cuck
[2:09 PM] pizza: now he's just our regular cuck
[2:09 PM] pizza: :heart: @공상
[2:10 PM] 공상: excuse
[2:10 PM] 공상: me
[2:10 PM] 공상: I am a beautiful cuck
[2:10 PM] 공상: tyvm
[2:10 PM] pizza: yep!
[2:10 PM] 공상: oh god o vomit
[2:10 PM] pizza: you're our cuck
[2:10 PM] 공상: I'm not beautiful I lied
[2:10 PM] pizza: some would even say
[2:10 PM] pizza: you're.....
[2:10 PM] 공상: just never say "yep!" again(edited)
[2:10 PM] pizza: a good friend.
[2:10 PM] pizza: Yep!
[2:10 PM] pizza: Okey dokey!
[2:10 PM] 공상: kdkxjdjs
[2:11 PM] 공상: I'm throwing up actually
[2:11 PM] 공상: in my mouth
[2:11 PM] pizza: Yes'm!
[2:11 PM] pizza: Alrighty then!
[2:11 PM] Raccoon Friend: My problem is that I have a weird issue with winning and losing. In any situation or game if I feel the pressure of competition it becomes this whole other thing that makes me really angry really easily. It doesnt happen with everything but It almost always happens with videogames.
[2:12 PM] pizza: I think it's because you subconciously associate losing at a videogame, casual or not, as like an indication that you're an inferior person or something
[2:12 PM] pizza: I think your mentality is "I can do all these other things, how am I messing up here or losing here? Man the other team must thing i'm a fucking moron"
[2:13 PM] pizza: But there's still a difference between getting mad in an inhouse with friends and getting mad at randies who we knew are better than us
[2:13 PM] pizza: like, I wasn't invested at all. I tried
[2:13 PM] pizza: but when i'd get shut down by someone who has 6x more hours than me, I'm not getting upset
[2:14 PM] pizza: maybe in the moment, I'm a little irked because it feels like it's not in my control, and part of it isn't.
[2:14 PM] pizza: but there's no stakes, they're just randies, I wasn't even keeping track of score until the finale when we got close enough to almost win
[2:17 PM] Raccoon Friend: Losers lose, winners win. Which one do you want to be? it's simple but it's really hard
[2:18 PM] Raccoon Friend: L4D2 is a particulary ungratifiying game when you are losing
[2:20 PM] Raccoon Friend: Im not saying anyone here is a loser. but when you lose at something, how do you not interpret it as reflection of yourself? at least a little bit right?
[2:21 PM] Raccoon Friend: Just ignoring a loss bc the oppenent is much, much better doesnt make it not a loss
[2:21 PM] pizza: I think you see it as too black and white
[2:21 PM] pizza: Like yeah losing is ungratifying, but it's not like we were just getting fucking pounded.
[2:22 PM] pizza: they still had two potatoes
[2:22 PM] pizza: we were down maybe like 30% on them by finale
[2:22 PM] Raccoon Friend: Yes there were some upsides to it, I had a good charge and a couple good booms
[2:22 PM] pizza: which is still whatever
[2:22 PM] Raccoon Friend: those moments were fun
[2:22 PM] pizza: like to me there are two kinds of losses that are ungratifying
[2:22 PM] pizza: ones where they're all just so fucking good that you can't do anything
[2:22 PM] pizza: bc it's not really in your control
[2:22 PM] pizza: you simply don't have enough hours to get anything on them
[2:22 PM] pizza: and they have so much more game experience that you can't do a single thing to any of them
[2:23 PM] pizza: and the other type is when you SHOULD have won but didn't because you just fucked up repeatedly
[2:23 PM] Raccoon Friend: At the end of the day though, close doesn't count as far as the record goes. W-L
[2:24 PM] pizza: what record
[2:24 PM] pizza: who's recording casual versus games against randies
[2:24 PM] Raccoon Friend: No one is counting casual l4d2 versus records on paper, obviously
[2:24 PM] pizza: Also worth mentioning that we won so
[2:24 PM] Raccoon Friend: but everyone is subconsciously keeping tally of aggragate win/loss in life
[2:25 PM] pizza: Even if good player didn't leave we took over lead in the time it took for his spawn to be up
[2:25 PM] pizza: So we won fair and square
[2:26 PM] pizza: And sure you'll keep track of how many times you lost in a macro sense
[2:29 PM] Raccoon Friend: If you asked a person on the street if they generally felt like a winner or loser, they would give you a pretty quick answer. But no one would admit to actively keeping track of every little win/loss in their daily endeavors. People just keep track of these things in the back of their minds, it plays a huge part in self-esteem maintenance
[2:31 PM] Raccoon Friend: and that's why when asked why they the opinion of themselves that they do, they saying it's just a feeling and they have trouble naming specific instances on a daily scale
[2:31 PM] pizza: I guess? Everyone loses at things they're not invested in though
[2:31 PM] pizza: CSGO pros would be worse at tf2 than even me unless they committed to the game
[2:31 PM] Raccoon Friend: And long term people dont stick with those things they lose more at and arent invested in
[2:32 PM] pizza: you tend to lose at things when you start out
[2:32 PM] pizza: also i'm sure if we actually had a record
[2:32 PM] pizza: you'd be positive
[2:32 PM] pizza: bc you've had the better team as well for most of practices
[2:32 PM] pizza: you've had josh and julian
[2:32 PM] pizza: i bet you've won more than lost in our inhouses
[2:32 PM] pizza: but you choose to remmeber the losses
[2:32 PM] pizza: and the fuckups
[2:50 PM] 공상: but like what you say about things not going at the exact same time leaving room to clear applies to people too
[2:50 PM] 공상: plus you guys have full power to have one player look out for your bot
[2:51 PM] 공상: on the flip side we have to look after both bots because they're prone to doing dumbass shit
[2:52 PM] 공상: additionally if we are leaving our two bots behind you can also use your three players to make a play on us as two
[2:52 PM] 공상: and the odds are in your favour of fucking us up
[2:54 PM] 공상: also, on a more general note, people might keep track of things they value and whether they succeed or fail
[2:54 PM] 공상: and if they think of themselves as successes or failures
[2:54 PM] 공상: but that rarely ever applies to everything that they do
[2:54 PM] 공상: like, I care about my winrate in taw because of pride
[2:55 PM] 공상: and because I know I am able to win more than I lose
[2:55 PM] 공상: but even then sometimes I just get ganked by enemy team being pizza and schizo and 3 decent players
[2:55 PM] 공상: and I have duckies and dj and Redman players
[2:55 PM] 공상: and at that point it's like well if I were 9k I could win but I'm not
[2:56 PM] 공상: so I just have to accept that experience as what it is
[2:56 PM] 공상: affirmation that I'm not 9k and i  am fallible and I still have stuff to learn(edited)
[2:56 PM] 공상: and I could let that get me down but why should I
[2:57 PM] 공상: I'm not supposed to win that game
[2:58 PM] 공상: further more I don't think the argument that people will have an answer about whether they are "winners" or "losers" is very strong because people are notoriously bad at self-diagnosis
[3:00 PM] 공상: their response will undoubtedly be flavoured by how their day is going, or week, or of they just found out that they failed and exam or what have you(edited)
[3:01 PM] 공상: personally, I have no idea about my overall winrate in versus is
[3:01 PM] 공상: because that's not entirely controllable by me
[3:01 PM] 공상: so it's not even that relevant
[3:02 PM] 공상: I am generally aware of my ability level(edited)
[3:02 PM] 공상: because that's all I personally can control
[3:02 PM] 공상: so if I underperformed then I would be upset
[3:02 PM] 공상: but if I'm just getting outplayed, I don't feel bad
[3:03 PM] 공상: because it's only natural for there to be better players
[3:03 PM] 공상: so as long as I'm playing well I'm content
[3:03 PM] 공상: same applies in dota
[3:03 PM] pizza: or playing to your ability
[3:03 PM] 공상: sometimes my best is just not good enough(edited)
[3:03 PM] pizza: sorry i'm in a dota game havne't contributed much to convo recently
[3:04 PM] Raccoon Friend: I just read all that and nothing seems unreasonable. I will say that  I feel I often get cockblocked by bots and I rarely seem them fuck up and not clear me. Maybe they just seem really good to me bc Im really bad at clearing.
[3:05 PM] Raccoon Friend: Also bots aren't affected by booms so it really devalues my 4 man booms kappa
[3:05 PM] Raccoon Friend: it's ok @pizza
[3:06 PM] 공상: idk they're affected
[3:06 PM] 공상: they're affected in a similar way to me from my experience
[3:06 PM] 공상: like did you watch the clip(edited)
[3:07 PM] Raccoon Friend: I suppose I get upset because I feel like me losing is often not within my control bc I dont have the time to practice L4d2 or dota. I've done basic practice with CSGO and it's actually really helped. So even though technically I am "in control of it" since I could just play a shit ton it still doesn't feel that way bc realistically I couldnt
[3:07 PM] 공상: pizza said that my view is quite clearer
[3:08 PM] Raccoon Friend: I did not
[3:08 PM] Raccoon Friend: lemme see
[3:09 PM] Raccoon Friend: Wow that is a lot clearer
[3:09 PM] Raccoon Friend: Mine is a more opaque green and the wave effect is more pronounced
[3:09 PM] 공상: yeah that's why I'm so confused when all you guys seem tk just take your hands off the mouse and keyboard and be like idk man I'm useless now
[3:10 PM] 공상: at most boom is a mild inconvenience
[3:10 PM] 공상: the common infected are the worst part lol
[3:10 PM] Raccoon Friend: When Im boomed I esentially can't see anything except 1-2 model lengths directly in front of me, assuming it's a lit area in the map
[3:10 PM] Raccoon Friend: does boom turn off the flashlight?
[3:11 PM] 공상: don't think so idk
[3:11 PM] 공상: I have a bad habit of turning it off lol
[3:11 PM] Raccoon Friend: same
[3:12 PM] Raccoon Friend: I have the cheapodeapo flashlight installed and sometimes it's too bright in well lit areas so I turn it off lol
[3:12 PM] 공상: I turn it off cus habits from campaign
[3:12 PM] 공상: cus it attracts common
[3:12 PM] Raccoon Friend: yeah
[3:12 PM] Raccoon Friend: I turn it off when entering a room so I have more time to pick off commons before they aggro
[3:16 PM] pizza: bots can still see things while boomed but bots don't know how to handle hordes
[3:16 PM] pizza: it's honestly just as effective against bots as it is against players, it's just different
[3:16 PM] pizza: their weaknesses are different
