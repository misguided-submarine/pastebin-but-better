[3:19 PM] saucy: i know it was really hard on you
[3:19 PM] saucy: and it was very shitty of me
[3:20 PM] fancy: it was
[3:20 PM] saucy: honestly, why do you still talk to me after what happened?
[3:21 PM] fancy: I'm not sure
[3:21 PM] fancy: I've cut off other people for a lot less
[3:21 PM] fancy: or at least I learned to, I wasn't always that way
[3:21 PM] fancy: tbh like
[3:21 PM] fancy: we kinda have a really weird relationship
[3:22 PM] fancy: I really don't think it's normal
[3:23 PM] fancy: like, idk if you also notice but I think it's pretty weird for other people to like, hang out with us
[3:24 PM] fancy: like our dynamic between the two of us doesn't really extend to a third or more people
[3:24 PM] fancy: pizza mentioned this to me the other day
[3:24 PM] fancy: cus like, if me and someone else
[3:24 PM] fancy: like Julian
[3:24 PM] fancy: are hanging out
[3:24 PM] fancy: it's just two friends doing shit
[3:24 PM] fancy: and then if pizza were to come along
[3:24 PM] fancy: it's like, no thing for him to join in and make it three friends doing shit
[3:25 PM] fancy: but that doesn't really apply to you and i, yeah?
[3:30 PM] fancy: idk if this would like, make you uncomfortable, but even when you come up when I'm talking to people and I like, explain a little bit of that story and everything, people are always like "why do you spend any more time or energy on her???"
[3:30 PM] fancy: I don't really have a good answer to that I don't think
[3:31 PM] fancy: I usually just say something like, it's really complicated
[3:32 PM] fancy: which is true and not true at the same time I think
[3:32 PM] saucy: i think with the friends thing, it's because we don't really have mutual friends
[3:32 PM] saucy: like with pizza...i'm not close to him at all
[3:32 PM] saucy: and he's probably my "closest" friend of yours
[3:33 PM] saucy: so i'm still pretty reserved around him
[3:33 PM] fancy: that might also be it
[3:33 PM] saucy: but yeah, i get what you mean
[3:33 PM] fancy: yeah idk if it would be different if there was someone we both knew well
[3:33 PM] saucy: i'm honestly surprised you still want to maintain any contact with me
[3:33 PM] fancy: idk I don't hate you
[3:33 PM] fancy: which I guess is like
[3:33 PM] fancy: iduno
[3:34 PM] saucy: when we started slowly talking again, i tried to maintain my distance
[3:34 PM] saucy: and sometimes, i'm not even sure what i can and cannot say
[3:34 PM] saucy: like i'm not exactly sure how to act around you
[3:34 PM] fancy: so like, maybe this is part of this...
[3:34 PM] fancy: I can explain something
[3:34 PM] fancy: uh
[3:34 PM] fancy: so like
[3:34 PM] fancy: generally, I think I'm like, at least pretty decent at figuring people out
[3:34 PM] fancy: and I'm good at figuring things out in general, right?
[3:35 PM] fancy: like I can read people pretty well
[3:35 PM] fancy: and that applies to most people
[3:35 PM] fancy: I can't read you at all
[3:35 PM] fancy: like
[3:35 PM] fancy: I actually got nothing
[3:35 PM] fancy: and maybe part of that has been you trying to be considerate and cautious
[3:35 PM] fancy: maybe part of it is just how it is
[3:36 PM] fancy: it seems strange because I still think we're like... pretty similar in a lot of ways
[3:36 PM] fancy: so it's strange that I just can't ever tell what you're thinking
[3:36 PM] fancy: like, not gonna lie, when you like
[3:37 PM] fancy: started suggesting we play games again
[3:37 PM] fancy: and it was pretty sudden
[3:37 PM] fancy: cus before this last couple weeks we were basically talking like
[3:37 PM] fancy: a couple times a month
[3:37 PM] fancy: I think?
[3:37 PM] fancy: my sense of time is really bad
[3:37 PM] fancy: and mostly about kpop or bad jobs
[3:38 PM] fancy: like really generic stuff
[3:38 PM] fancy: but then like
[3:38 PM] fancy: the last couple weeks and days especially were a lot different
[3:38 PM] fancy: at least that's what I was perceiving
[3:38 PM] fancy: and then like when I learned you had just broken up with the guy you were dating
[3:38 PM] fancy: I was more than a little suspicious
[3:38 PM] fancy: cus like
[3:37 PM] fancy: I think?
[3:37 PM] fancy: my sense of time is really bad
[3:37 PM] fancy: and mostly about kpop or bad jobs
[3:38 PM] fancy: like really generic stuff
[3:38 PM] fancy: but then like
[3:38 PM] fancy: the last couple weeks and days especially were a lot different
[3:38 PM] fancy: at least that's what I was perceiving
[3:38 PM] fancy: and then like when I learned you had just broken up with the guy you were dating
[3:38 PM] fancy: I was more than a little suspicious
[3:38 PM] fancy: cus like
[3:39 PM] fancy: it's really easy to keep seeing the same patterns in everything
[3:39 PM] fancy: cus it's like, really natural to see patterns in stuff
[3:39 PM] fancy: so I kinda just
[3:39 PM] fancy: didn't really know what to think
[3:40 PM] fancy: I didn't know what you were doing but it felt really accusatory to just be like
[3:40 PM] fancy: "what is this"
[3:40 PM] fancy: "what are you doing"
[3:40 PM] fancy: because nothing you were doing was like
[3:40 PM] fancy: explicitly bad or something
[3:40 PM] fancy: but just because of
[3:40 PM] fancy: who we are
[3:40 PM] fancy: it all adds up to be potentially... questionable
[3:41 PM] saucy: no, i totally understand
[3:41 PM] saucy: i didn't really think of it that way, tbh
[3:41 PM] saucy: we used to be really close
[3:41 PM] saucy: and yeah, you were right about how we'd talk on and off
[3:41 PM] saucy: like just once every couple of months
[3:42 PM] saucy: small talk shit
[3:42 PM] saucy: i do like, go through moments with my longtime friends, where we'd chat a little bit
[3:43 PM] saucy: and then probably like for a few days we'd talk a lot
[3:43 PM] saucy: and then we go back to the same routine
[3:43 PM] saucy: but it's kinda like, even if we haven't really talked much in a while, when we do it's like things haven't changed
[3:43 PM] saucy: i do somewhat feel that way with you too
[3:43 PM] saucy: but obviously given the past with what i have done, i'm not sure how i should approach you
[3:44 PM] saucy: i'm not sure if i should just pretend like nothing has happened
[3:44 PM] saucy: frankly, that's...very insulting to you
[3:44 PM] saucy: so i am unsure a lot of times how i should act around you
[3:45 PM] saucy: when i was dating the other guy before, we spent a lot of our time together
[3:45 PM] saucy: like probably a bit too much
[3:45 PM] saucy: i haven't spoken to my friends very much since i started working
[3:45 PM] saucy: since the break up, i've had more time to myself and to my friends
[3:46 PM] saucy: then you mentioned the mvp ellis thing, and it kinda made me miss playing l4d2
[3:46 PM] saucy: but i apologize if it was so sudden
[3:46 PM] saucy: i totally understand if you were like...cautious about everything
[3:46 PM] saucy: but if you really aren't comfortable playing something, you can let me know and be honest about it
[3:46 PM] saucy: or just say a no
[3:47 PM] fancy: well that's the thing right
[3:47 PM] fancy: like, I've thought about this some, and I think that it's really unnatural that I don't feel at all uncomfortable interacting with you
[3:47 PM] fancy: like
[3:47 PM] fancy: at this point, it should be kinda awkward to talk to you, or play games, or whatever
[3:48 PM] fancy: but like, every single time we come back to it, it feels like nothing changed
[3:48 PM] fancy: obviously like, if I think about it consciously it can start to feel awkward
[3:49 PM] fancy: but I feel like, if I kinda just relax and chill out
[3:49 PM] fancy: it's just like the old times
[3:49 PM] fancy: idk if you know what I mean
[3:49 PM] fancy: and like
[3:49 PM] fancy: about the stuff that happened
[3:49 PM] fancy: obviously it did happen and we can't really deny that it did
[3:49 PM] fancy: but like....
[3:50 PM] fancy: the way I look at it
[3:50 PM] fancy: and maybe this is fucked up and I'm deluded or something
[3:50 PM] fancy: but like
[3:50 PM] fancy: I'm pretty okay with the person I am today
[3:50 PM] fancy: I like myself
[3:50 PM] fancy: and it's really hard to regret anything in particular that has happened
[3:50 PM] fancy: because the only reason I am who I am today is because of all the things in my life that have happened to me
[3:50 PM] fancy: and I don't know how much any one thing is responsible for
[3:51 PM] fancy: if that makes sense
[3:51 PM] fancy: cus like, if I said that I regretted our past, that kinda implies that I wish I were a different person today
[3:51 PM] fancy: and I don't know if that's true
[3:52 PM] saucy: yeah, i know what you mean
[3:52 PM] saucy: do you remember like
[3:52 PM] saucy: i think it was last week
[3:52 PM] saucy: when i asked if i could still talk about gross shit around you?
[3:52 PM] fancy: yeah I remember that
[3:52 PM] saucy: that was kind of an example of what i meant
[3:52 PM] saucy: when i said i wasn't sure how to act around you
[3:53 PM] saucy: because yeah, i agree that things should be awkward
[3:53 PM] saucy: if we talk or play games
[3:53 PM] saucy: but it isn't
[3:53 PM] saucy: so on one hand, i still feel perfectly comfortable telling you whatever's on my mind
[3:54 PM] saucy: like if i need to go take a shit i'll just tell you
[3:54 PM] saucy: but on the other hand, i shouldn't be so comfortable either
[3:54 PM] saucy: and i don't know if it's appropriate
[3:54 PM] saucy: or even fair to you, in a sense
[3:54 PM] saucy: if you get what i am saying
[3:54 PM] fancy: I don't think so
[3:54 PM] fancy: idk
[3:54 PM] fancy: cus like
[3:54 PM] fancy: that stuff doesn't bother me
[3:55 PM] saucy: like, i don't really feel i deserve your time honestly
[3:55 PM] saucy: because i know i hurt you so badly
[3:55 PM] saucy: and for me to just pretend and act like nothing has happened
[3:55 PM] saucy: it's just like inconsiderate and a huge disservice to you
[3:55 PM] fancy: I don't think that's really pretending like it didn't happen
[3:56 PM] fancy: cus like, I don't think the only reason we ever were that close was because we liked each other
[3:56 PM] fancy: if that makes sense?
[3:56 PM] fancy: maybe I'm wrong
[3:56 PM] fancy: it's really hard from like, inside the situation, to tell
[3:56 PM] fancy: cus I'm sure everyone else would look at us and be like
[3:56 PM] fancy: y'all are fucking weirdos
[3:57 PM] fancy: but it doesn't feel weird
[3:57 PM] saucy: lol for sure
[3:57 PM] saucy: i don't think it's really normal either
[3:57 PM] saucy: like our relationship
[3:57 PM] saucy: it's...complicated
[3:57 PM] fancy: and simple
[3:57 PM] fancy: all at the same time
[3:57 PM] fancy: cus like at the end of the day
[3:58 PM] fancy: we are the way we are with each other
[3:58 PM] fancy: because we want to be
[3:58 PM] fancy: off topic
[3:58 PM] fancy: I really liked that album
[3:58 PM] fancy: a lot more than their previous one
[3:59 PM] saucy: are you talking about panic at the disco?
[3:59 PM] fancy: yeah
[3:59 PM] saucy: and yeah, i guess so
[3:59 PM] fancy: their last album was really weird
[3:59 PM] fancy: that one felt a lot more like
[3:59 PM] fancy: them
[3:59 PM] fancy: I liked it more
[3:59 PM] saucy: they're okay lol
[4:00 PM] saucy: not really my cup of tea
[4:00 PM] fancy: I like their earlier stuff a lot
[4:00 PM] fancy: but my friend in high school really liked them too
[4:00 PM] fancy: as did one of my ex's
[4:00 PM] fancy: so
[4:00 PM] fancy: I'm biased
[4:00 PM] fancy: but anyway
[4:00 PM] fancy: maybe you're right and if we were to judge objectively
[4:00 PM] fancy: maybe you don't deserve my time
[4:00 PM] fancy: but like
[4:01 PM] fancy: what good is that
[4:01 PM] fancy: like it's really hard for me to ascribe meaning to the concept that anything does or doesn't deserve something
[4:02 PM] fancy: because no other part of life seems to work that way
[4:02 PM] fancy: my friend asked the other day
[4:02 PM] fancy: how I even still like you
[4:02 PM] fancy: or think about you
[4:02 PM] fancy: because if it was her she'd just forget about you and move on
[4:03 PM] fancy: all I said was like
[4:09 PM] fancy: love is described as a fire sometimes right.... sometimes it can be brief and bright and passionate and obsessive and intense like flames. and sometimes it can just be subdued and persistent like smoldering coals... and the latter is what it's like for me I think. I don't know if you know that feeling at all. 

I don't think I'll ever stop loving you and caring about you as a person, even if we never talked again, id still feel that way I think. even while we weren't talking I felt that way. I'd still die for you if I had to.

tbh, it's a really confusing feeling if you've never felt it before, I think, and it's really hard to describe to anyone. but it's why I think I can forgive you more than I can forgive other people. It's probably similar to like... parents toward their children or something... idk. people try to assign categories to different kinds of love and shit but I think it's all the same imo.
[4:10 PM] fancy: I think that's part of what makes us so weird, since we don't actually fit any traditional categories for anything
[4:10 PM] fancy: it's weird, and that probably contributed to my confusion for a long time since I didn't know what I was supposed to think of you
[4:11 PM] fancy: I mean, even now I still don't really know what to think of you as... other than just you
[4:11 PM] fancy: idk if you know what I mean
[4:12 PM] fancy: idk that might all be a little weird lol
[4:13 PM] saucy: i think i somewhat have an idea
[4:14 PM] saucy: i guess like, if you only focus on the negatives it's easy to tell yourself to just leave and move on
[4:14 PM] saucy: we had a lot of great times regardless
[4:14 PM] saucy: it's definitely harder for you
[4:14 PM] fancy: it's less of a "kawaii uguu my panties are soaked" and more of a "every time she's mentioned I smile a little" feeling
[4:14 PM] fancy: lol
[4:14 PM] saucy: yeah, i thought so lol
[4:15 PM] saucy: maybe it's nostalgia or something
[4:15 PM] saucy: because we really did have a lot of special moments
[4:15 PM] saucy: like moments that i only shared with you
[4:15 PM] saucy: you know what i mean
[4:15 PM] fancy: yeah
[4:15 PM] saucy: like the level of intensity
[4:15 PM] saucy: i mean
[4:15 PM] fancy: I mean we used to
[4:15 PM] fancy: piss everyone off
[4:15 PM] saucy: yeah lol
[4:15 PM] fancy: we were kinda assholes
[4:15 PM] fancy: lol
[4:15 PM] saucy: just kinda?
[4:15 PM] fancy: okay we were assholes
[4:15 PM] fancy: lol
[4:15 PM] saucy: we were big time assholes
[4:16 PM] saucy: aghs lifestealer
[4:16 PM] fancy: yeah...
[4:16 PM] fancy: LOL
[4:16 PM] saucy: that really triggered nukey
[4:16 PM] fancy: and the constant
[4:16 PM] fancy: having a second conversation
[4:16 PM] fancy: over text
[4:16 PM] saucy: yeah...
[4:16 PM] fancy: while everyone else was talking
[4:16 PM] saucy: oops
[4:16 PM] fancy: oops
[4:16 PM] saucy: that was really rude tho
[4:16 PM] saucy: not gonna lie
[4:16 PM] fancy: we were not nice to them
[4:16 PM] saucy: yeah
[4:16 PM] fancy: I feel bad
[4:16 PM] saucy: it's no wonder people don't like us
[4:16 PM] saucy: i do too
[4:16 PM] fancy: it was like
[4:16 PM] fancy: that friend in high school
[4:16 PM] fancy: that gets a girlfriend
[4:16 PM] fancy: and then just
[4:16 PM] fancy: dies
[4:16 PM] fancy: to the world
[4:16 PM] saucy: yeah, exactly
[4:16 PM] fancy: that was us
[4:17 PM] saucy: yeah lol
[4:17 PM] fancy: we probably spent too much time together I think
[4:17 PM] fancy: "together"
[4:17 PM] fancy: you know what I mean
[4:17 PM] saucy: hanging out
[4:17 PM] saucy: yeah
[4:17 PM] fancy: 2, 3 am
[4:17 PM] fancy: every night
[4:17 PM] saucy: but to go back what we were just talking about
[4:17 PM] saucy: it's...really your decision what you'd want to do with me
[4:18 PM] saucy: but i know you're cautious
[4:18 PM] fancy: that is a very very lewd statement out of context lol(edited)
[4:18 PM] saucy: and i know i fucked up really badly
[4:18 PM] saucy: oh my god
[4:18 PM] saucy: you know what i mean
[4:18 PM] fancy: even with the dots
[4:18 PM] fancy: like
[4:18 PM] saucy: STOP IT LOL
[4:18 PM] fancy: the dots just add to it
[4:18 PM] fancy: lmfao
[4:18 PM] saucy: jesus
[4:18 PM] saucy: okay
[4:18 PM] fancy: good job
[4:18 PM] fancy: but yeah like
[4:18 PM] saucy: you can decide if you want to continue talking to me or not
[4:18 PM] fancy: I don't hold any of it against you
[4:18 PM] saucy: but i know i'd have to rebuild that trust
[4:18 PM] saucy: and if anything i do makes you uncomfortable
[4:18 PM] saucy: please let me know
[4:18 PM] fancy: yeah
[4:18 PM] fancy: I'm glad like we could have this conversation
[4:19 PM] fancy: because like
[4:19 PM] fancy: tbh I knew it was like
[4:19 PM] fancy: the only way to figure out what the fuck was going on
[4:19 PM] fancy: but I was like
[4:19 PM] fancy: pretty hesitant to have it
[4:19 PM] fancy: cus i wasn't sure how it was gonna go
[4:20 PM] saucy: no, i really understand
[4:20 PM] saucy: i'm glad you brought it up with me
[4:20 PM] saucy: because i wasn't like aware how  uhhh
[4:20 PM] saucy: like, how it looked like from your perspective
[4:20 PM] saucy: to me, it just meant i had more time to play with my friends
[4:21 PM] saucy: but i totally understand from yuor point of view
[4:21 PM] saucy: how it'd look suspicious
[4:21 PM] fancy: yeah, plus with how I am, it wouldn't even be unreasonable to think that you just see me as some fail safe source of affirmation
[4:21 PM] fancy: if that makes sense
[4:22 PM] saucy: yeah,. i understand
[4:22 PM] saucy: i'm sorry i worried you and made you anxious about it
[4:22 PM] saucy: i didn't think of it at all from your perspective
[4:22 PM] saucy: but yeah, if you just need me to back off
[4:22 PM] saucy: do let me know
[4:22 PM] fancy: sure thing
[4:22 PM] fancy: you know like
[4:22 PM] fancy: I still
[4:23 PM] fancy: don't blame you entirely for what happened
[4:23 PM] fancy: which might seem strange I guess
[4:24 PM] fancy: but yeah like honestly at this point I think, especially now after this, I think that I've gotten enough figured out that I don't think you really have to worry about being too careful
[4:25 PM] fancy: cus I like how we are and I like that we can joke and be really fucking savage and lewd and flirty and rude and dumb
[4:25 PM] fancy: because it's really refreshing to feel like I can just
[4:25 PM] fancy: say whatever
[4:26 PM] fancy: and you (probably) won't judge me
[4:26 PM] fancy: :NayeonMHM:
[4:26 PM] fancy: 

[4:26 PM] fancy: plus I mean anyone that can deal with this I have to hold on to cus like(edited)
[4:26 PM] fancy: man
[4:27 PM] fancy: I look like I got hella issues
[5:38 PM] saucy: LOL
[5:38 PM] saucy: well, i did tell you to send it to me
[5:38 PM] saucy: because i wanted to show you something
[5:38 PM] saucy: your picture won't show
[5:38 PM] fancy: did you really tell me if we're twins
[5:38 PM] saucy: unless i have exactly one text from you
[5:38 PM] saucy: like even if i have texts from you unread
[5:38 PM] fancy: isn't that like me telling myself
[5:38 PM] saucy: it won't show
[5:38 PM] fancy: oh yeah
[5:38 PM] fancy: I know what you mean
[5:38 PM] saucy: it took me a while to figure it out last night
[5:39 PM] saucy: but i also like it a lot i can just be myself
[5:39 PM] saucy: and you won't judge
[5:39 PM] saucy: too much
[5:39 PM] saucy: no matter how stupid i am
[5:39 PM] saucy: or lewd
[5:39 PM] saucy: or stupid
[5:39 PM] fancy: you probably could have told me and I would have been able to tell you the answer
[5:39 PM] fancy: lol
[5:39 PM] saucy: but it had to be a susprise
[5:39 PM] fancy: susprise
[5:39 PM] fancy: yes
[5:39 PM] fancy: I like susprises
[5:39 PM] fancy: but yeah
[5:39 PM] fancy: it's like
[5:39 PM] fancy: kindergarten
[5:39 PM] fancy: when like
[5:39 PM] fancy: you and this random other kid would just be like
[5:39 PM] fancy: hey
[5:39 PM] fancy: we're friends now
[5:39 PM] fancy: okay
[5:39 PM] fancy: and it's simple
[5:40 PM] saucy: omg lmao
[5:40 PM] saucy: surprise
[5:40 PM] saucy: you fuck
[5:40 PM] saucy: and yeah, basically
[5:40 PM] saucy: but i am glad we're talking
[5:40 PM] saucy: because i can talk to you about twice
[5:41 PM] saucy: and basically anything
[5:41 PM] saucy: it just comes natural
[5:41 PM] saucy: naturally
[5:42 PM] fancy: yeah
[5:42 PM] fancy: it's nice
[5:42 PM] fancy: like
[5:42 PM] fancy: I have a lot of fun
[5:42 PM] fancy: just
[5:42 PM] fancy: feeding in l4d
[5:42 PM] fancy: and talking about whatever
[5:42 PM] fancy: like a inappropriate amount of fun
[5:43 PM] saucy: https://puu.sh/ALjQv/2e34fee231.jpg

[5:43 PM] saucy: yeah, me too
[5:43 PM] saucy: l4d2 was fun
[5:43 PM] fancy: LFMAO
[5:43 PM] saucy: because i can just say whatever
[5:43 PM] saucy: and be myself
