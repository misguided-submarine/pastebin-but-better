[2:08 PM] Suck it, Moto!: How are you?
[2:08 PM] fancy: bad
[2:08 PM] Suck it, Moto!: bad how
[2:08 PM] fancy: bad stressed
[2:08 PM] Subhanshu: bad angst
[2:09 PM] fancy: angst is a personal thing
[2:09 PM] Suck it, Moto!: what is stressing you?'
[2:09 PM] fancy: people
[2:09 PM] Suck it, Moto!: specific people?
[2:09 PM] fancy: yes
[2:09 PM] Suck it, Moto!: names?
[2:09 PM] fancy: era
[2:09 PM] fancy: gage
[2:10 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Work people?
[2:10 PM] fancy: no
[2:10 PM] Suck it, Moto!: C
[2:10 PM] fancy: yes
[2:10 PM] Subhanshu: they're csgo peopole
[2:10 PM] Suck it, Moto!: CSHO people
[2:10 PM] Suck it, Moto!: ?
[2:10 PM] Suck it, Moto!: ah
[2:10 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Well CSGO people shouldnt be stressing you out
[2:10 PM] fancy: they're not really just csgo people anymore
[2:11 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Okay
[2:11 PM] Suck it, Moto!: so
[2:11 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Are they venting their problems to you?
[2:11 PM] Suck it, Moto!: and you're stressed about them?
[2:11 PM] fancy: sorta kinda
[2:11 PM] fancy: I'm stressed I can't do anything about them
[2:11 PM] fancy: can't fix it
[2:12 PM] fancy: can't wire transfer pain and suffering
[2:12 PM] fancy: so I'm worried
[2:12 PM] Subhanshu: this is how the people do
[2:12 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Gonna be honest, I think you might be disporportionally invested here
[2:12 PM] fancy: that's probably the least helpful thing to say tbh
[2:13 PM] fancy: and probably but
[2:13 PM] fancy: I can't really help it
[2:13 PM] Subhanshu: yeah waht andrew said
[2:13 PM] fancy: I can't just not care
[2:13 PM] Suck it, Moto!: So why allow yourself you be stressed out about things outside of your control
[2:13 PM] Subhanshu: everyone has their own problems and stress
[2:13 PM] Subhanshu: these just happen to be two people you ran into and talked to for a few hours
[2:13 PM] Suck it, Moto!: besdies you just met these people
[2:13 PM] Subhanshu: spend enough time talking to anyone about their problems and you'll see how much pain there is
[2:14 PM] fancy: so just because I just met them, I should care?
[2:14 PM] Subhanshu: like i understand caring for them
[2:14 PM] Subhanshu: nothing wrong with that
[2:14 PM] fancy: that's such a cold way to live
[2:14 PM] Subhanshu: but as he said, disproportionaly invested
[2:14 PM] fancy: shouldn't*
[2:14 PM] Subhanshu: it's not a 100% invested or 0% invested
[2:14 PM] fancy: if I were 100% invested I would do more
[2:14 PM] fancy: and I wonder if I shouldn't
[2:15 PM] fancy: but I don't know what I'm supposed to do
[2:15 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Im not saying they aren't worth caring about, but to be so invested emotionally that their problems are affecting your day-to-day so soon after meeting them is a little alarming
[2:15 PM] fancy: I don't know what the right thing to do is
[2:15 PM] fancy: it's alarming to be invested in people now?
[2:15 PM] Suck it, Moto!: The right thing to do is to be there and talk to them if they want it
[2:15 PM] Suck it, Moto!: and nothing more
[2:15 PM] fancy: but sometimes that's not enough
[2:15 PM] Subhanshu: like even if i meet someone who's suffering a lot more than you, i'd be more invested into you because i know you more and care more about you
[2:15 PM] Subhanshu: not enough for what
[2:15 PM] Subhanshu: to make them 100% happy
[2:16 PM] fancy: to fix things
[2:16 PM] Subhanshu: well uhh that's not going to happen
[2:16 PM] Suck it, Moto!: You can't solve other people problems for them
[2:16 PM] fancy: thus my issue
[2:16 PM] fancy: they can't solve it, I can't solve it
[2:16 PM] fancy: no one can solve it
[2:16 PM] fancy: sometimes things in life just are, and there's no reason why, and that's awful
[2:17 PM] fancy: because no one deserves a life where their family doesn't want them
[2:17 PM] Suck it, Moto!: hmmm. I have to drive a friend to the airport now but I'll be back within the hour
[2:17 PM] Suck it, Moto!: brb
[2:17 PM] fancy: and they're told they're worthless
[2:17 PM] Subhanshu: so you're getting stressed about something you fan't fix
[2:17 PM] Subhanshu: well
[2:17 PM] Subhanshu: tell them they're not worthless
[2:17 PM] Subhanshu: and then you've done your job
[2:17 PM] fancy: they don't believe me
[2:17 PM] fancy: that's not good enough
[2:17 PM] fancy: how on earth can you rest easy
[2:17 PM] fancy: knowing someone else is in pain
[2:18 PM] fancy: someone you know
[2:18 PM] fancy: someone you care about
[2:18 PM] fancy: that makes you like everyone else. that makes you exactly like what those people say when they say that "you say you care but it doesn't really affect you so it doesn't mean anything"
[2:20 PM] fancy: I can handle losing in dota
[2:20 PM] fancy: I can handle losing games
[2:20 PM] fancy: I can handle losing a lot of things
[2:20 PM] fancy: but people matter
[2:20 PM] fancy: there's no second try with people
[2:20 PM] fancy: you fail and it's over
[2:22 PM] Subhanshu: the earth as like 7 billion people
[2:22 PM] Subhanshu: everyone suffers
[2:22 PM] Subhanshu: some more than others
[2:22 PM] Subhanshu: i don't know why you're NOW feeling bad about this
[2:22 PM] fancy: you see my problem
[2:22 PM] fancy: I've always felt bad about this
[2:22 PM] fancy: I just stopped talking to people
[2:22 PM] fancy: for a really long time
[2:22 PM] fancy: because this is what happens to me
[2:22 PM] Subhanshu: so now that you've met two people that suffer like everyone else, it's something to stress about
[2:23 PM] fancy: it's like a alcoholic who doesn't have a problem until he relapses
[2:23 PM] fancy: it reminds me of the pain in the world
[2:23 PM] fancy: it reminds me how bad I am at fixing it
[2:23 PM] fancy: it reminds me how limited I am
[2:23 PM] fancy: it reminds me that this is the world I am a part of
[2:24 PM] fancy: where these kinds of things can happen
[2:25 PM] fancy: where things happen to people and it's not their fault, and it changes their entire lives. it makes them worse.
[2:25 PM] fancy: where some people just never get a chance
[2:26 PM] Subhanshu: Yep yep
[2:26 PM] fancy: I don't know how you live with that
[2:26 PM] fancy: it's disgusting
[2:42 PM] Subhanshu: Okay
[2:47 PM] Suck it, Moto!: There's evil and suffering in the world, and as individuals we can do little to make a dent in it
[2:48 PM] Suck it, Moto!: but that can't prevent us from leading lives of joy and fullfillment
[2:48 PM] Suck it, Moto!: it  CANT
[2:48 PM] Suck it, Moto!: We help where we can
[2:48 PM] Suck it, Moto!: and dont let things outside of our control keep us down
[2:49 PM] Suck it, Moto!: because if we do, we become a part of the problem
[2:50 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Josh you reminding these people they are worth something is already doing more that most people
[2:50 PM] Suck it, Moto!: most people would do nothing
[2:50 PM] Suck it, Moto!: so thank you
[2:50 PM] fancy: caring is a problem? wanting to do everything you can is a problem?
[2:50 PM] fancy: just because everyone else is worse
[2:50 PM] fancy: doesnt mean I did good enough
[2:51 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Caring is not a problem. But letting these things depress you to the point that you cant do anything is
[2:53 PM] fancy: when did I stop doing things
[2:53 PM] fancy: when did being stressed and worried preclude doing things
[2:53 PM] fancy: I care about people so what they go through affects me
[2:53 PM] fancy: directly
[2:53 PM] fancy: I'm not going to pretend life is all sunshine ad flowers
[2:53 PM] fancy: that's the most selfish thing
[2:54 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Well you said things are bad when I asked how you were,  "I just stopped talking to people
for a really long time
because this is what happens to me"
[2:54 PM] fancy: I mean things are bad
[2:54 PM] fancy: but me not talking to people is because I'm not good enough
[2:54 PM] fancy: I'm not string enough and I should be
[2:54 PM] fancy: strong*
[2:54 PM] Suck it, Moto!: you can lead the happy life without being delusional and pretending everything is fine when it isnt
[2:55 PM] fancy: that's exactly what it being delusional is
[2:55 PM] fancy: you can't care about someone for real(edited)
[2:55 PM] fancy: and be okay while they're suffering
[2:58 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I disagree. if Person X is going through a rough time, and I care about them, I'll support them the best I can while still doing the things I need to do to function.
[2:59 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I'm still "okay" if a close friend is going through something hard. Being there for them and remaining oaky is like the defintiion of strength
[3:00 PM] Suck it, Moto!: If every time I got dumped by a girl and broke down Gabe broke down too, we'd both have hung ourselves by now
[3:01 PM] Suck it, Moto!: but that hasnt happened because Gabe pulled me OUT of those situations by being there for me
[3:01 PM] fancy: you don't break down to the person
[3:01 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Not becasue he decided to jump in the hole wit hme
[3:01 PM] fancy: you don't get to be weak to them
[3:01 PM] fancy: but having not affect you
[3:01 PM] fancy: is so fake
[3:02 PM] Subhanshu: not really
[3:02 PM] Subhanshu: you're sad beacuse you're doing everything you can to help and it's not enough
[3:02 PM] Suck it, Moto!: It does affect me, but I dont let it take control
[3:02 PM] Subhanshu: after some point it's out of your control, you've done what you can
[3:02 PM] Subhanshu: yes you can be somewhat depressed about it
[3:02 PM] fancy: so we just pretend it's all fine
[3:02 PM] Suck it, Moto!: NO
[3:03 PM] Subhanshu: it's sad that like 20 veterans commit suicide every day, but i don't let that thought permeate everything I do
[3:03 PM] Subhanshu: It's sad that there are kids who have never eaten a full meal
[3:03 PM] fancy: I still came and played stupid video games
[3:03 PM] fancy: I still go to work
[3:03 PM] fancy: I still eat
[3:03 PM] fancy: but this is what I spend my free time on now
[3:03 PM] fancy: and if you ask me how things are
[3:03 PM] fancy: I'm not going to lie and pretend they're not bad
[3:04 PM] Suck it, Moto!: We aren't pretending anything
[3:04 PM] Subhanshu: ^^
[3:05 PM] Subhanshu: i dunno why you correlate not being 100% affected by cruelty in the world with delusion
[3:06 PM] fancy: ??? because you're telling me I shouldn't say things are bad
[3:06 PM] fancy: things are bad
[3:06 PM] fancy: that is a fact
[3:07 PM] fancy: I am stressed about this because I have a friend who will kill herself if her relationship with her boyfriend ever falls apart
[3:07 PM] fancy: I'm not miserable
[3:07 PM] fancy: I'm stressed
[3:07 PM] fancy: I'm worried
[3:07 PM] fancy: I'm not depressed
[3:07 PM] fancy: I'm angry
[3:08 PM] Subhanshu: someone once told me that it was dumb to get mad at something you can't control
[3:08 PM] fancy: it is
[3:08 PM] fancy: but what if this is something I could have controlled
[3:08 PM] Suck it, Moto!: You dont know that
[3:08 PM] fancy: what if there's things I can say and do
[3:08 PM] fancy: that's why it's a what if
[3:08 PM] Subhanshu: you're not perfect
[3:08 PM] fancy: no shit Sherlock
[3:08 PM] Subhanshu: now you can choose to get angry about not being perfect
[3:09 PM] Subhanshu: brooding about it fixes nothing
[3:09 PM] fancy: so we should just embrace ignorance?
[3:09 PM] Subhanshu: you being angry and down isn't helping anything whatsoever
[3:09 PM] fancy: just because I'm not sure what the right thing to do means I shouldn't be mad when I don't think to do it
[3:09 PM] Suck it, Moto!: that's not what we're suggesting geez
[3:09 PM] Subhanshu: saying "oh i'm just sharing their suffering" isn't helping anyone
[3:09 PM] fancy: it isn't to hep anyone it's just something that is
[3:10 PM] fancy: I am suffering because they are
[3:10 PM] fancy: I feel bad because I fee their pain
[3:10 PM] Suck it, Moto!: If someone's stuck in a hole in the ground you find a way to pull them out you dont jump in the hole with them
[3:10 PM] fancy: I'm not in the fucking hole
[3:10 PM] fancy: I'm standing with a rope and ladder and all these tools and I don't know how to use them
[3:10 PM] fancy: to get them out
[3:10 PM] Subhanshu: sometimes you can't
[3:10 PM] fancy: that's what I'm doing
[3:10 PM] Subhanshu: sometimes ladder is too short
[3:10 PM] fancy: and sometimes you can
[3:10 PM] Subhanshu: sometimes well is too deep
[3:10 PM] Subhanshu: yeah sometimes you can
[3:10 PM] Subhanshu: you have
[3:11 PM] fancy: but when you fail
[3:11 PM] Subhanshu: you have done that in the past
[3:11 PM] fancy: people fucking die
[3:11 PM] fancy: that's what's on the line
[3:11 PM] fancy: blood
[3:11 PM] fancy: is on the line
[3:11 PM] fancy: there is no second chance
[3:11 PM] fancy: this isn't a game
[3:11 PM] fancy: this is people
3:11 PM] fancy: parts of my heart
[3:11 PM] fancy: I've given to people
[3:11 PM] fancy: and I fail them
[3:12 PM] fancy: this isn't oh you can learn and do better next time
[3:12 PM] fancy: because everyone is different
[3:12 PM] Suck it, Moto!: If you dont have the proper tools to get someone out of the hole, then the best thing you can do is stay there and offer them words of encouragement and maybe somone with a longer rope will come by
[3:12 PM] Suck it, Moto!: blood is on the line? is this a slipknot song?
[3:12 PM] fancy: life is blood
[3:12 PM] fancy: blood is life
[3:12 PM] fancy: etc
[3:12 PM] fancy: Shakespeare thing
[3:13 PM] fancy: but like
[3:13 PM] Suck it, Moto!: so edgey
[3:13 PM] fancy: yeah I guess Shakespeare was edgy
[3:13 PM] fancy: but just because I tried my best
[3:13 PM] fancy: doesn't mean my best didn't suck
[3:13 PM] fancy: when you can't do something you want to do the first time
[3:14 PM] fancy: you can learn

The Secret Asian Man
Family Guy: Feelings!

[3:14 PM] fancy: you can try again
[3:14 PM] fancy: this is one arena where that doesn't work
[3:14 PM] fancy: if I fuck something up, people aren't just inconvenienced
[3:14 PM] fancy: or annoyed
[3:14 PM] fancy: they suffer and die
[3:14 PM] fancy: I'm gambling with lives
[3:15 PM] fancy: and I don't even know the rules
[3:15 PM] Suck it, Moto!: If you don't feel equiped to say and do the right things to save these people then dont take the responsibilities
[3:15 PM] fancy: so just don't try
[3:16 PM] fancy: gotcha
[3:16 PM] fancy: good advice
[3:16 PM] Suck it, Moto!: What do you want me to say?
[3:16 PM] fancy: yes it sucks sorry man life is pretty lame
[3:16 PM] Subhanshu: waow
[3:16 PM] fancy: not tell me how I'm wrong for caring
[3:16 PM] Subhanshu: as long as you, josh, are putting effort into hleping them when you can
[3:16 PM] Subhanshu: you're helping
[3:17 PM] fancy: don't tell me it's good enough
[3:17 PM] fancy: I don't want that
[3:17 PM] fancy: share in the fact that sometimes I'm not good enough
[3:17 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Personally, What I care about here is that the people in this chat are doing okay and not depressed
[3:17 PM] Suck it, Moto!: that's my motivation her
[3:17 PM] Suck it, Moto!: hrere
[3:17 PM] Subhanshu: well you're not good enough
[3:17 PM] Subhanshu: sometimes
[3:17 PM] Subhanshu: yeah
[3:17 PM] Subhanshu: of course
[3:17 PM] Subhanshu: no one is
[3:17 PM] fancy: I can deal with that, I don't want to deal with fake affirmation
[3:17 PM] Subhanshu: i'm saying what you're doing helps
[3:17 PM] Subhanshu: whether it helps enough
[3:18 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Even if it doesnt seem like you're making a big impact on these people Josh it does help
[3:18 PM] Suck it, Moto!: even if its not visible
[3:19 PM] fancy: I never thought it didn't help
[3:19 PM] fancy: but don't tell me that not helping enough is good enough
[3:19 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Yes so Subhanshu saying what you're doing is good enough isnt fake affirmatiojn
[3:19 PM] fancy: because that's a lie
[3:19 PM] fancy: good enough is succeeding
[3:19 PM] Suck it, Moto!: wrong
[3:20 PM] Suck it, Moto!: the pathway to success is paved with failure
[3:20 PM] Subhanshu: and what is success
[3:20 PM] Subhanshu: good, you've prevented someone from killin gthemselves
[3:20 PM] Subhanshu: but now they're sad about their financial status
[3:20 PM] fancy: success is when you do it all right
[3:20 PM] Subhanshu: oh you fixed their financial qualms by giving them good advice and tips
[3:20 PM] Subhanshu: but now they're sad about girls and how they can't find anyone
[3:20 PM] Subhanshu: and how they always blow it
[3:20 PM] Subhanshu: and oh great, now you've fixed that
[3:21 PM] Subhanshu: you've made them someone who has foudn the love of their life
[3:21 PM] Subhanshu: oh but now they have a son who has issues and doesn' tlisten to them
[3:21 PM] fancy: so we just pick a point where their problems stop mattering?
[3:21 PM] Subhanshu: uhhhh
[3:21 PM] Subhanshu: yes, you have to
[3:21 PM] fancy: that's comforting...
[3:21 PM] Subhanshu: otherwise you'll spend the rest of your life telling one other person how to live their life
[3:21 PM] Subhanshu: it's not sunshine and rainbows lol
[3:21 PM] Subhanshu: being sad about it all is the easiest thing to do
[3:21 PM] Subhanshu: you have to draw the line somewhere
[3:21 PM] Suck it, Moto!: "being sad about it all is the easiest thing to do" so true
[3:22 PM] fancy: I'll go somewhere else with my frustation next time I guess.
[3:22 PM] Subhanshu: okay
[3:22 PM] Suck it, Moto!: okay
[3:22 PM] Subhanshu: you come to us
[3:22 PM] Subhanshu: and you wnana hear certain words from us
[3:22 PM] Subhanshu: that validate you
[3:22 PM] Subhanshu: and when you don't get them
[3:22 PM] fancy: I want to hear my friends support me not tell me I'm wrong
[3:22 PM] Subhanshu: "oh well let's just be delusional"
[3:22 PM] fancy: just because
[3:22 PM] fancy: you can draw a line
[3:22 PM] fancy: and stop caring after that
[3:22 PM] Subhanshu: true friends tell you what they feel about them, not just blindly validate you because you're sorta down
[3:22 PM] fancy: doesn't mean we all should
[3:22 PM] fancy: or can
[3:23 PM] fancy: or want to
[3:23 PM] Subhanshu: if you want a squad of "yes men" to butter you up and validate you, then look elsewhere
[3:23 PM] Subhanshu: we try to better ourselves
[3:23 PM] Suck it, Moto!: we real niggas
👅1
💯1
👊1
[3:23 PM] Subhanshu: you've bettered me in some ways
[3:23 PM] Subhanshu: andrew's bettteed me in some ways
[3:23 PM] Subhanshu: these are true friends
[3:23 PM] Subhanshu: if what you're looking for isn't advice, but for validations
[3:23 PM] fancy: but apparently at some point
[3:23 PM] Subhanshu: ask someone else
[3:23 PM] fancy: we're supposed to stop caring about bettering people
[3:23 PM] fancy: that's what your'e telling me
[3:23 PM] fancy: becuase oh no it might get too much for us
[3:23 PM] Subhanshu: not stop caring, but draw the line and decide what time to use for yourself and what time to help others
[3:23 PM] fancy: so we draw lines
[3:23 PM] Suck it, Moto!: There's only so much in your power to do
[3:24 PM] Subhanshu: the only limiting factor in life is time
[3:24 PM] Suck it, Moto!: the lines can change too
[3:24 PM] Subhanshu: if you commit 3 whole days only to other people, you'd literally die
[3:24 PM] Subhanshu: because you wouldn't have had water
[3:24 PM] Subhanshu: or sleep
[3:24 PM] Subhanshu: the line sholudn't be that close, but you need to understand your limits
[3:24 PM] Subhanshu: what you're capable of doing
[3:24 PM] Subhanshu: and when to let go
[3:24 PM] fancy: but that doesn't mean I'm supposed to take my feelings about them and put them in a locker when I dont' need them
[3:24 PM] Subhanshu: lol
[3:24 PM] Subhanshu: every time
[3:24 PM] Subhanshu: it's the "pretend they're not there"
[3:25 PM] fancy: because taht's what you're sayign to me
[3:25 PM] Subhanshu: you think everyone who isn't depressed about the things you are is just delusional
[3:25 PM] Subhanshu: no we'r enot
[3:25 PM] fancy: it's not a switch
[3:25 PM] fancy: I don't just stop knowing there is pain because I need to eat dinner
[3:25 PM] fancy: I don't stop wondering what I should be doing
[3:25 PM] fancy: thinking about things I shoudl say
[3:25 PM] fancy: because I'm driving to work
[3:26 PM] fancy: because all those things are a means to an end
[3:26 PM] fancy: people matter
[3:26 PM] Suck it, Moto!: We arent preteding thisngs dont suck for people, we arent deluding ourselves into not caring about things, we choose to do what we are capapble of doing and not let things outside of our control ruin us emotionally
[3:26 PM] Subhanshu: sometimes we slip
[3:26 PM] Subhanshu: sometimes my shit internet gets the better of me
[3:26 PM] Subhanshu: it's weak
[3:26 PM] Subhanshu: but i do it sometimes
[3:26 PM] Subhanshu: giving into those things is a weak thing to do
[3:26 PM] Subhanshu: the easiest thing to do
[3:26 PM] fancy: I think it's fake to just choose times to let things affect us differently
[3:26 PM] Subhanshu: like giving into an addiction
[3:27 PM] fancy: that's not really feeling it
[3:27 PM] Subhanshu: that's like saying it's really fake to pretend i don't want a cigarette after smokeing for 3 consecutive years
[3:27 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Then Im the fakest motherfucker here
[3:27 PM] Subhanshu: like mentally i want the cigarette because addiction and nicotine
[3:27 PM] fancy: it is fake?
[3:27 PM] fancy: that's like the definition of fake
[3:27 PM] Subhanshu: but i make the decision not to have it because i know it will worsen me
[3:27 PM] fancy: it's still affecting you
[3:27 PM] fancy: what
[3:27 PM] fancy: how is that the same
[3:27 PM] fancy: at all
[3:27 PM] fancy: the addiction is still affecting you
[3:27 PM] fancy: whether you act on it or not
[3:28 PM] fancy: just like I'm still goign to be affected by the things hurting my friends
[3:28 PM] fancy: whether I'm talking to them or not
[3:28 PM] fancy: that's what real is
[3:29 PM] fancy: me beign strong about it and not showing it when I talk to them
[3:29 PM] fancy: is like resisting a cigarette
[3:29 PM] fancy: I'm still affected
[3:29 PM] fancy: I'm always affected
[3:30 PM] Suck it, Moto!: If Gabe calls me sobbing becasue XYZ, and I spend an hour talking him down and comforting him, that's all I can do at the moment. But I dont spend the hour of math class immediatley after  just thinking about Gabe and being sad in class, I pay attention in class, take notes, and learn the material. I still need to do well in that class regardless if Gabe is sad or not
[3:30 PM] fancy: That's like me going to work
[3:31 PM] fancy: I don't understand what you're saying
[3:31 PM] Suck it, Moto!: So does that make me fake because im deciding to go into math mode and not be sad about gabe?
[3:31 PM] Subhanshu: according to josh, yes
[3:31 PM] fancy: how are you not still just sad?
[3:31 PM] fancy: despite it all?
[3:31 PM] fancy: like it doesn't turn off for me
[3:31 PM] fancy: I go to work
[3:31 PM] fancy: I do things
[3:31 PM] Subhanshu: honestly, if i was depressed and i was telling a friend, i'd feel far worse if i now made that friend depressed
[3:31 PM] fancy: but I still think about her
[3:32 PM] fancy: like can you not do both at the same tiem?
[3:32 PM] Subhanshu: you're worse off by letting their depression bleed into everything you do
[3:32 PM] Suck it, Moto!: if I did both at the same time i wouldnt be able to focus in class
[3:32 PM] fancy: what does that mean
[3:32 PM] Subhanshu: yeah wha tadnrew said
[3:32 PM] fancy: that doesn't happen for me
[3:32 PM] fancy: I just think about both things
[3:33 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Multitasking is not rea lddue
[3:33 PM] Suck it, Moto!: dude
[3:33 PM] fancy: I can still focus?
[3:33 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I guess you got 2 brains fam
[3:33 PM] fancy: it doesn't take 100% of my attention to do things
[3:33 PM] fancy: barely anythign does
[3:34 PM] fancy: but like pretendign it's not affecting me is just bottling it all up
[3:34 PM] fancy: that's what I usually do
[3:34 PM] fancy: I used to pretend that everything was fine
[3:34 PM] fancy: all the time
[3:34 PM] Suck it, Moto!: wow
[3:34 PM] fancy: and I was infinitely worse off
[3:34 PM] fancy: like I don't choose to feel bad about era
[3:34 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Why are you insisting that we "pretend"
[3:34 PM] fancy: I just feel bad
[3:34 PM] fancy: because that's what I would have to do
[3:34 PM] fancy: I can't just say
[3:34 PM] fancy: oh I'm just not gonna feel sad rn because I have to xyz
[3:35 PM] fancy: my feelings aren't a switch
[3:35 PM] fancy: I can't just turn ones on and off?
[3:35 PM] fancy: like
[3:35 PM] fancy: that's probably why what you're saying doens' tmake sense
[3:35 PM] fancy: I think
[3:35 PM] fancy: for the longest time I pretended my life was fine
[3:35 PM] fancy: I pretended I wasn't sad about things I was sad about
[3:35 PM] fancy: I never talked about them
[3:35 PM] Subhanshu: well your life is fine
[3:36 PM] fancy: thanks
[3:36 PM] fancy: apparently
[3:36 PM] fancy: I don't have any pain
[3:36 PM] fancy: nice
[3:36 PM] fancy: never did
[3:36 PM] fancy: never will
[3:36 PM] fancy: apparently
[3:36 PM] fancy: like wtf man
[3:36 PM] fancy: if you want to choose an arbitrary line where if the average is above it everythign is fine go ahead
[3:36 PM] fancy: but I had stuff I should have talked baout
[3:36 PM] fancy: to people
[3:36 PM] fancy: but I never did
[3:36 PM] fancy: because I pretended it was all okay
[3:37 PM] fancy: and that's how I got to where I was
[3:37 PM] Subhanshu: "How's your leg?"
"it's fine"
"oh, so you mean you'v enever felt pain in your leg? Your leg is the sexiest, strongest, most toned leg in the world, and you've never felt pain and never will? If I shot it tomorrow it would still be fine?"
[3:37 PM] fancy: you telling me that my life is fine in response to me saying I used to just bottle up everythign I should have talked about
[3:37 PM] fancy: is telling me I never had anythign I shoudl have ever talked about
[3:38 PM] fancy: so I wasn't "pretending my life was fine" because my life "was fine"
[3:38 PM] fancy: apparently being depressed and lonely and everything is all fine now?
[3:38 PM] fancy: or are you telling me I wasn't those things?
[3:39 PM] Suck it, Moto!: "you telling me that my life is fine in response to me saying I used to just bottle up everythign I should have talked about
is telling me I never had anythign I shoudl have ever talked abou"
[3:39 PM] Suck it, Moto!: not what he's saying at all
[3:39 PM] Suck it, Moto!: you are twisting it that way
[3:39 PM] fancy: for the longest time I pretended my life was fine
I pretended I wasn't sad about things I was sad about
I never talked about them
[3:39 PM] fancy: well your life is fine
[3:39 PM] fancy: seems to me
[3:39 PM] fancy: that's what he's saying
[3:39 PM] fancy: either that or it's completely not relevant
[3:39 PM] fancy: because we were talkinga bout how I used to do thigns
[3:40 PM] fancy: not how my life is now
[3:40 PM] fancy: sure my life is "fine" now
[3:40 PM] fancy: but my life wasn't fine before
[3:40 PM] fancy: and the reason it wasn't fine is because I never talked about anythign that was starting to be a problem
[3:40 PM] fancy: this whole thing was me tryign to do somethign different
[3:40 PM] fancy: maybe not bottle it up so much
[3:41 PM] fancy: people would ask me how I was
[3:41 PM] fancy: I'd say fine
[3:41 PM] fancy: things weren't fine
[3:42 PM] fancy: so now you ask how things are
[3:42 PM] fancy: I say pretty bad
[3:42 PM] fancy: because things are pretty bad
[3:42 PM] fancy: not debilitatingly bad
[3:42 PM] fancy: not immoblizingly bad
[3:42 PM] fancy: just bad
[3:42 PM] fancy: that's all I was saying
[3:42 PM] fancy: and then I got told I shouldn't care so much
[3:43 PM] fancy: I should just stop feeling sometimes
[3:43 PM] fancy: can you understand where I'm coming from?
[3:43 PM] Suck it, Moto!: the way you've described them they sound like it's debilitatingly bad for you
[3:43 PM] fancy: when did I say I stopped going to work or talking to people or playing games
[3:43 PM] fancy: or eating
[3:43 PM] fancy: or any of that stuff
[3:43 PM] fancy: you kept asking about them
[3:43 PM] fancy: and I explained
[3:43 PM] fancy: how I felt about it
[3:44 PM] Subhanshu: I'm sorry Josh, accept it or not, you came here for validation. You told us this because you thought we could just be like "yeah josh I understand your pain we get where you're coming from" and you could say "you don't understand tho" and then the world could keep spinning. Don't come to Andrew and I for validation. We're not that one-dimensional. If you want to talk to people for hours who will just agree with everything you say, either get a few mirrors, or talk to some people that don't know any better, who don't actually care about you, and just wanna validate you. Find those people and talk about your feelings to them instead, if yes-men are all you want. I'm sorry, but Andrew and I care too much about you to just tell you what your ears wanna hear. Even as we speak and tell you what we genuinely think is best for you, you cherry-pick what you want to listen to and either 'accept' that, or take those words out of context, put them in your own context, and assume that that's what we're saying. During that one week when you were so fucking excited and nothing could get you down, I told you to be careful. You responded by saying "wtf man i'm happy and this is what you're gonna say to me? like holy sht what a dick thing to say you always makeit about you." I was looking out for you, and at the time, you were ungrateful. That's how this goes. If we dont' say what you want us to say, you just say "oh well i'll just talk to someone else".
[3:44 PM] fancy: you like
[3:44 PM] fancy: I don't understand
[3:44 PM] fancy: why you think that telling me straight up that I'm wrong to feel the way I feel
[3:45 PM] fancy: is the proper way to be supportive
[3:45 PM] fancy: like
[3:45 PM] fancy: i'm not saying you just have to be like
[3:45 PM] Subhanshu: not wrong, just not in your overall best interest as an individual
[3:45 PM] fancy: oh yeah you're right
[3:45 PM] fancy: but you basically said "just dont' feel like that"
[3:45 PM] Subhanshu: there it is again
[3:45 PM] Subhanshu: that's basically all we're saying
[3:45 PM] fancy: you told me there's nothign I can do
[3:45 PM] fancy: so might was well be good enough
[3:45 PM] Subhanshu: we can write a 15 page essay, and you'd take one sentence in the introduction and say "you'r ebasically saying ___"
[3:46 PM] fancy: consdiering the introduction should summarize your point
[3:46 PM] fancy: yes
[3:46 PM] Suck it, Moto!: We never said there was nothing you can do
[3:46 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I told you repeatedly that you sending kind wrods to these CSGO folks is good and you should do waht you can
[3:48 PM] Subhanshu: "so what you're saying is to pretend nothing is wrong"
[3:48 PM] Suck it, Moto!: but there are some things outside of your control and we did say there is nothing MORE you can do about those thigns
[3:50 PM] fancy: Pizza - Today at 2:13 PM
everyone has their own problems and stress
these just happen to be two people you ran into and talked to for a few hours
Pizza - Today at 2:13 PM
spend enough time talking to anyone about their problems and you'll see how much pain there is

--implying I shouldn't care so much because everyone has pain

Pizza - Today at 2:17 PM
so you're getting stressed about something you fan't fix
well
tell them they're not worthless
and then you've done your job

--implying that I should just settle for something less because it's good enough and all I was supposed to do

Pizza - Today at 2:22 PM
the earth as like 7 billion people
everyone suffers
some more than others
i don't know why you're NOW feeling bad about this

--in response to me saying I have a hard time failing people when there are real consequences, saying "well everyone suffers so oh well"
[3:50 PM] fancy: the subtext to all this is that
[3:50 PM] fancy: "stop feeling so bad because you can't do anything more"
[3:51 PM] fancy: when the entire reason I feel bad is BECASUE i can't do anything more
[3:51 PM] fancy: that's the entire point
[3:51 PM] fancy: it's like me saying I don't liek water beacuse it's tasteless
[3:51 PM] fancy: and you saying that I shoudl like water because it's tasteless
[3:51 PM] fancy: liek what
[3:51 PM] Suck it, Moto!: "--implying __" every instance of this is you putting words in his mouth, it's so blatant
[3:52 PM] fancy: okay
[3:52 PM] fancy: then tell me what
[3:52 PM] fancy: so you're getting stressed about something you fan't fix
well
tell them they're not worthless
and then you've done your job.
[3:52 PM] fancy: that means
[3:52 PM] fancy: otehr than I should settle
[3:52 PM] fancy: because it's "all I'm supposed to do"
[3:52 PM] fancy: tell me andrew
[3:55 PM] Suck it, Moto!: it's up to you to decicde how far to go. if you want to fly across the country and take them from their abusive homes and let them live in yout basement, or call child protective services, that's your choice. But im guessing you arent prepared/equipped to do those things
[3:55 PM] Subhanshu: ^^^
[3:55 PM] fancy: how does that
[3:55 PM] Subhanshu: if you care so much
[3:55 PM] Subhanshu: you can eithe rbe sad about it
[3:55 PM] fancy: address my question
[3:55 PM] Subhanshu: ot go fly to them and help them
[3:55 PM] Subhanshu: you have to draw the line somewhere
[3:55 PM] fancy: didn't I cover that when I said I didn't know if I should be doing more
[3:55 PM] Subhanshu: that is something you CAN do
[3:55 PM] Subhanshu: and something that WILL help
[3:56 PM] fancy: you don't know that
[3:56 PM] fancy: I don't know that it would help
[3:56 PM] fancy: thus the problem
[3:56 PM] fancy: if I knew with like 80% certainty
[3:56 PM] fancy: that flyign to see this person
[3:56 PM] fancy: and be with them
[3:56 PM] fancy: or take them away
[3:56 PM] fancy: would help
[3:56 PM] fancy: I would do it
[3:56 PM] fancy: I can't know that
[3:56 PM] fancy: that's why I'm frustrated and stressed
[3:56 PM] fancy: because I don't know what helps and what doesn't
[3:57 PM] Suck it, Moto!: you've expreseed in the past people get to know you and take advantage of your kindness/generosity. I dont want these kids on CSGO to take advantage of you
[3:57 PM] Subhanshu: ^^
[3:57 PM] fancy: what
[3:57 PM] fancy: how
[3:57 PM] fancy: what
[3:57 PM] fancy: ?
[3:57 PM] Subhanshu: people using you to comfort themselves and leaving youat the curb when they're done with you
[3:57 PM] Subhanshu: that kind of taking advantage of you
[3:57 PM] fancy: yeah it happens
[3:58 PM] fancy: so what
[3:58 PM] Subhanshu: the one you've experienced before, the kind we have all experienced before
[3:58 PM] Subhanshu: so what
[3:58 PM] Subhanshu: oh okay
[3:58 PM] Subhanshu: oh
[3:58 PM] Subhanshu: oh
[3:58 PM] Subhanshu: ka
[3:58 PM] fancy: yeah I'm goign to feel like shit
[3:58 PM] fancy: it's the way it works
[3:58 PM] fancy: I can't just ignore them
[3:58 PM] fancy: because they might do something bad later?
[3:58 PM] fancy: how can you justify that
[3:59 PM] fancy: I don't understand
[3:59 PM] Subhanshu: "how can you justify that"
As in, you think we justify that?
[3:59 PM] Suck it, Moto!: All I said is I dont want these poeple to take advantage of you
[3:59 PM] fancy: me either
[3:59 PM] fancy: but i mean
[4:00 PM] Subhanshu: all i'm saying is it's easy to take advantageof someone that is so willing to put themselves out for someone
[4:00 PM] fancy: naught you can do about that
[4:00 PM] Subhanshu: if some kid was liek "hey josh give me a knife otherwise i'll kill myself, i just need to know that someone is willing to give stuff to me"
[4:00 PM] fancy: if you're not willing, eventually there will be someone who really needs it, but you were too scared to give it
[4:00 PM] Subhanshu: you give them knife, and they say "k thanks i didn't kill msyelf, and then leave and never talk to you
[4:00 PM] Subhanshu: you're just gonna be like "so what that's how it works"
[4:00 PM] fancy: who says that lol
[4:00 PM] fancy: and I probably would and think nothing of it
[4:00 PM] Subhanshu: well then stop complaining about being taken advantage of, if it's so inconsequential to you
[4:00 PM] fancy: that's such a small investment
[4:00 PM] Subhanshu: if it's just a necessary evil
[4:01 PM] Subhanshu: even though that's not how you feel
[4:01 PM] fancy: there's a difference between
[4:01 PM] fancy: givign someone
[4:01 PM] fancy: 8 years of your life
[4:01 PM] fancy: and giving them one day
[4:01 PM] Subhanshu: you're just saying that because if you said how you felt, it would contradict what you've been saying th epast few minutes
[4:01 PM] Subhanshu: what about all the fluff about
[4:01 PM] Subhanshu: giving your heart
[4:01 PM] Subhanshu: and blood
[4:01 PM] fancy: ?
[4:01 PM] fancy: I didn't spend 20 hours
[4:02 PM] fancy: talking to this knife person
[4:02 PM] fancy: opening up about my self
[4:02 PM] fancy: learnign abotu everything in their lives
[4:02 PM] fancy: and the things they hope for
[4:02 PM] fancy: and the things they fear
[4:02 PM] fancy: they just were like hey give knife and then we don't talk again
[4:02 PM] fancy: see: luna, basically
[4:02 PM] fancy: how can you say that's the same investment?
[4:03 PM] fancy: yeah, when Brit ditched me I was pretty upset and hurt, because we'd opened up so much to each other and I thought I knew her
[4:03 PM] fancy: turns out I didn't
[4:03 PM] fancy: yeah when Ash left I was upset because I thought I knew her too
[4:03 PM] fancy: turns out not really
[4:04 PM] fancy: how's that the same as someone who just uses me for a knife?
[4:04 PM] fancy: that's like 200 dollars
[4:04 PM] fancy: that's like 2 days of work
[4:04 PM] fancy: who gives a flying shit lol
[4:04 PM] fancy: I didn't put any signficant time into them
[4:04 PM] fancy: I didn't spend time learnign who they are
[4:04 PM] fancy: and wondering how I could help them
[4:04 PM] fancy: telling them stuff I don't usually tell people
[4:05 PM] fancy: I don't complain about the people who take advantage of me in passing
[4:05 PM] fancy: I've only ever complained about the peopel I thoguht were actually friends
[4:11 PM] Suck it, Moto!: You've been pretty mad in the past about people taking advantage of you, even in small ways that only amount to a day's work or something. but now that It's not in the interest of your point to care about that you're just shrugging off the small things. okay
[4:14 PM] fancy: have I ever stayed mad for a long time about it?
[4:15 PM] fancy: have I consistently complained about somethign long after I've had to deal with it?
[4:15 PM] fancy: like that
[4:15 PM] fancy: do I still complain about my old boss at Kroger now that I quit?
[4:16 PM] fancy: do I still complain about people from uni?
[4:16 PM] fancy: do I still complain about what my current boss did 3 weeks ago?
[4:16 PM] fancy: even two days ago?
[4:16 PM] fancy: of course everyone gets mad about things in the moment while they're happening
[4:16 PM] fancy: you would know andrew
[4:16 PM] Subhanshu: you still complain about lucas baiting you two days ago
[4:17 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Yes I would lol
[4:17 PM] fancy: yea because he's gonna keep doing it
[4:17 PM] fancy: because that's what lucas does
[4:17 PM] fancy: you think if we loaded into an inferno game
[4:17 PM] fancy: he wouldn't do it again
[4:17 PM] fancy: ?
[4:17 PM] Subhanshu: yeah you can't control that
[4:18 PM] Subhanshu: i just don' get what you're trying to say with all this 
have I consistently complained about somethign long after I've had to deal with it?
like that
do I still complain about my old boss at Kroger now that I quit?
do I still complain about people from uni?
do I still complain about what my current boss did 3 weeks ago?
even two days ago?
[4:18 PM] fancy: because andrew told me that I usually complaina bout the small stuff until it's not relevant
[4:18 PM] fancy: and my point is that
[4:18 PM] fancy: everyone complains about the small stuff when it ahppens
[4:18 PM] fancy: beacuse it's annoying
[4:18 PM] fancy: but none of it has really affected me
[4:18 PM] fancy: in the long term
[4:18 PM] fancy: the big stuff has
[4:19 PM] fancy: I don't care any more that what my old boss did
[4:19 PM] fancy: I don't care what peopel from uni did
[4:19 PM] fancy: they did it and it's over
[4:19 PM] fancy: I don't have to deal with it any more
[4:19 PM] fancy: I'm not dealing with it any more
[4:19 PM] fancy: I'm still dealing the effects of fundamental betrayal
[4:19 PM] fancy: by people I thought I was close to
[4:20 PM] fancy: same thing where if luna never talks to me again I'll be like meh whatever
[4:20 PM] fancy: even though I gave him $180 knife
[4:20 PM] fancy: that's minor
[4:20 PM] fancy: this girl killing herself
[4:21 PM] fancy: I'd feel bad about for ever
[4:21 PM] Suck it, Moto!: did you really give a $180 knife to someone you just met online
[4:21 PM] fancy: yeah
[4:21 PM] Suck it, Moto!: why
[4:21 PM] fancy: because of the reaction
[4:21 PM] fancy: it felt good
[4:22 PM] fancy: I made his week
[4:22 PM] fancy: and he probably won't ever forget it
[4:22 PM] fancy: my other choice was have 180 dollars
[4:22 PM] Suck it, Moto!: do you realize the potential here for them to take advasntage of you
[4:22 PM] fancy: sure
[4:22 PM] fancy: but I got what I wanted out of it
[4:22 PM] fancy: it's like paying for a service
[4:22 PM] fancy: I paid to make someone happy
[4:22 PM] fancy: he completely lost his shit
[4:23 PM] fancy: it was the best feeling
[4:23 PM] Subhanshu: fancy - Today at 4:22 PM
sure
but I got what I wanted out of it
[4:23 PM] Suck it, Moto!: so you bought a friend
[4:23 PM] fancy: no I bought happiness
[4:24 PM] Subhanshu: that will appreciate it the same way
[4:24 PM] Suck it, Moto!: you realize they will "react" however you want now so you'll keep giving them shit right
[4:24 PM] Subhanshu: ^^^^^^^^^
[4:24 PM] fancy: no beacuse it's not as real
[4:24 PM] fancy: it's pretty obvious
[4:24 PM] Suck it, Moto!: is it tho
[4:24 PM] fancy: yeah kinda
[4:24 PM] Subhanshu: I can roleplay random poor girl and say "hey i'm gonna kill myself if someone doesn't show me that they care enough to give me material things"
[4:25 PM] fancy: you can
[4:25 PM] Subhanshu: also faking those kinds of reactions is so fucking easy
[4:25 PM] fancy: uh huh
[4:25 PM] fancy: glad to know that
[4:26 PM] Suck it, Moto!: total honesty here and I say this not to insult you Josh, but because I care about you and you happiness and your wallet: These kids probably think you're a total sucker and are gonna keep you around so you will keep buying them knives
[4:27 PM] fancy: some of them do
[4:27 PM] fancy: we don't buy them knives
[4:27 PM] fancy: I appreciate the concern though
[4:28 PM] fancy: but I'm not going to regret it
[4:28 PM] fancy: it's just money
[4:28 PM] Suck it, Moto!: holy shit dude you're in denial right now
[4:29 PM] fancy: ?
[4:29 PM] Subhanshu: fancy - Today at 4:22 PM
sure
but I got what I wanted out of it
[4:29 PM] fancy: you're trying to get me to feel bad
[4:29 PM] fancy: because I made a kid happy?
[4:29 PM] fancy: becuase maybe they'll sucker me out of more stuff?
[4:29 PM] fancy: or are you telling me
[4:29 PM] fancy: luna and gage
[4:29 PM] Subhanshu: *complains for years about how people he gets close to just use him
[4:29 PM] fancy: weren't fucking overwhelmed
[4:29 PM] Subhanshu: *says that it doesn't matter it's just some time and money
[4:29 PM] fancy: time matters money doesn't
[4:30 PM] Subhanshu: money = time
[4:30 PM] Subhanshu: you spent time on earning money
[4:30 PM] fancy: no
[4:30 PM] Suck it, Moto!: ^^^
[4:30 PM] fancy: you can't buy more time with money
[4:30 PM] Suck it, Moto!: yes
[4:30 PM] fancy: you can trade tiem for money
[4:30 PM] fancy: but not the other way
[4:30 PM] Subhanshu: that time was for the sole purpose of earning money
[4:30 PM] fancy: I already spent the time
[4:30 PM] fancy: I don't need the 180 dollars sitting around
[4:30 PM] Subhanshu: for a car
[4:30 PM] Subhanshu: or an education
[4:30 PM] Subhanshu: or a computer
[4:30 PM] fancy: I have money for a car
[4:30 PM] fancy: I'm not going back to school
[4:30 PM] fancy: I'll get a computer when I really need it
[4:30 PM] Subhanshu: *constantly talks about how he realizes he needs to go to school
[4:31 PM] fancy: yeah
[4:31 PM] fancy: but I'm not going to
[4:31 PM] Subhanshu: also, when you "need" it is gonna change based on how much money you have
[4:31 PM] Subhanshu: more denial
[4:31 PM] fancy: unless you want to see me actually kill myself
[4:31 PM] fancy: are you saying that we should never give anythign away
[4:32 PM] fancy: or only to people that "deserve" it
[4:32 PM] Subhanshu: oh boy
[4:32 PM] fancy: should we do away with charites because people abuse those?
[4:32 PM] Subhanshu: here it is again
[4:32 PM] fancy: I don't understand
[4:32 PM] Subhanshu: here's the "so you're saying _"
[4:32 PM] fancy: why you have such a problem with what I did
[4:32 PM] fancy: yes it's a question
[4:32 PM] fancy: you fuck
[4:32 PM] fancy: because I don't udnerstand
[4:32 PM] fancy: the point of you tryign to tell me
[4:32 PM] fancy: that giving was bad
[4:32 PM] Subhanshu: I have a problem with my best friend being taken advantage of, even if you don't
[4:32 PM] Subhanshu: I have a problem with a friend being addicted to cocaine and alcohol, even if they don't
[4:32 PM] fancy: so are you telling me the reactions weren't real?
[4:33 PM] fancy: and that I didn't enjoy it?
[4:33 PM] fancy: and I didn't get soemthing worth more than money out of it?
[4:33 PM] Subhanshu: i think you're in denial about that reaction being worth 2 days of work. I think you're in denial when it comes to people keeping you around for the purpose of giving you skins so that they can be happy
[4:33 PM] Subhanshu: i'm not saying everyone's oding that
[4:33 PM] fancy: what are you talking about
[4:33 PM] Subhanshu: i'm not saying anyone in particular is doing that
[4:34 PM] fancy: I'm not denying people are doing that
[4:34 PM] fancy: I admitted some of them are
[4:34 PM] fancy: and I said "we don't give them knives"
[4:34 PM] Subhanshu: bu ti think you saying "so what it's just 200 dollars" is such bullshit and delusional
[4:34 PM] fancy: what
[4:34 PM] fancy: ?
[4:34 PM] fancy: what I got was worth more than 200 dollars
[4:34 PM] fancy: I feel better than I would having 200 more dollars
[4:34 PM] fancy: did you not hear me
[4:34 PM] fancy: that night?
[4:35 PM] fancy: weren't you the one saying that I got more out of it than they did
[4:35 PM] fancy: that I enjoyed it more
[4:35 PM] Subhanshu: I said it sounds like you'r emore excited about giving him thing
[4:35 PM] fancy: yeah
[4:35 PM] fancy: how is that different
[4:35 PM] fancy: than what I said
[4:36 PM] fancy: I don't know why you're so bent on telling me that the way I'm living my life is wrong
[4:37 PM] fancy: like, yeah people are going to use me again, but the alternative is to become a cold asshole
[4:37 PM] fancy: and I'm not doing that
[4:37 PM] Subhanshu: once again, black and white
[4:37 PM] Subhanshu: are andrew and i cold assholes according to you
[4:37 PM] fancy: so because you don't think what I do is worth it
[4:37 PM] fancy: means I shouldn't?
[4:37 PM] fancy: about this, kinda yea
[4:38 PM] fancy: you're being pretty cold about this whole thing
[4:38 PM] fancy: like, of course people could be using me
[4:38 PM] fancy: it's a risk
[4:38 PM] fancy: it's always a risk
[4:38 PM] fancy: sometimes I get burned
[4:38 PM] fancy: it's going to happen
[4:38 PM] fancy: and I'm going to feel like shit
[4:38 PM] fancy: but it makes me feel good about myself
[4:38 PM] Subhanshu: if someone i met two days ago gave me a 200 dollar knife, i'd feel partly bad and think "man, this person's generosity is probably taken advantage of on a daily basis and he thinks he's getting something out of it"
[4:38 PM] fancy: how is this about you now?
[4:39 PM] fancy: and what do you mean
[4:39 PM] fancy: "he think's he's getting somethign out of it"
[4:39 PM] fancy: I did get somethign out of it
[4:39 PM] fancy: I felt better
[4:39 PM] fancy: I feel better
[4:39 PM] fancy: I'm happier
[4:39 PM] fancy: that I did it
[4:39 PM] fancy: how is that hard to accept
[4:39 PM] Subhanshu: that's the biggest delusion of them all
[4:39 PM] Subhanshu: they don't appreciate it like you think they do
[4:39 PM] fancy: does that really matter
[4:39 PM] fancy: when I feel better
[4:40 PM] fancy: ?
[4:40 PM] fancy: that was the goal
[4:40 PM] fancy: I feel good about what I did
[4:40 PM] fancy: why ruin it
[4:40 PM] Subhanshu: this whole time you've complained about how deluding yourself to feel better is despicable
[4:40 PM] Subhanshu: and here you are doing it
[4:40 PM] Subhanshu: and defending it
[4:40 PM] Suck it, Moto!: If someone I met 2 days ago gave me a $200 disc that I dreamed of getting, I would be slightly happy, more confused, emabarrassed, and freaked out because I'd think "wow this guy must be a sucker"
[4:40 PM] Subhanshu: you're deluding yourself, and you're not just gonna wake up by having us tell you that
[4:40 PM] Subhanshu: some day you'll find out
[4:41 PM] fancy: I'm deluding myself that I feel good about it?
[4:41 PM] fancy: what
[4:41 PM] Subhanshu: some day you'll feel hollow inside and wonder where all the time and money and "friends" you "bought:" went
[4:41 PM] fancy: I feel how I feel
[4:41 PM] fancy: that's how that works
[4:41 PM] fancy: I'm not gonna wonder where luna went
[4:41 PM] Suck it, Moto!: like gifting someone a big nice thing like that is great, but with you somone you just met it's wildly innappropriate
[4:41 PM] Subhanshu: you're basically saying "since you can't contorl how you feel, you can't delude yourself"
[4:41 PM] Subhanshu: "you can't be deluding yourself since you can't control how you feel"
[4:42 PM] fancy: you said I deluded myself about how I'm feeling
[4:42 PM] Subhanshu: yes
[4:42 PM] fancy: I know how I'm feeling
[4:42 PM] Subhanshu: which oyu are
[4:42 PM] fancy: ?
[4:42 PM] fancy: what the actual fuck
[4:44 PM] fancy: Pizza - Today at 4:40 PM
	this whole time you've complained about how deluding yourself to feel better is despicable

	I complained about pretending you don't feel bad. That's delusional. I don't stop feeling bad because I'm doing somethign else. 				
    Apparently you guys can? It doesn't work like that for me. I would have to legit pretend I'm not feeling bad. It doesn't work.
[4:44 PM] fancy: I'm not pretending I'm feeling good
[4:44 PM] fancy: I'm not telling myself I'm feeling good
[4:44 PM] fancy: I just am feeling good
[4:44 PM] fancy: but apparently I don't know what I'm feeling ever apparently
[4:45 PM] fancy: and all my feelings are delusional
[4:45 PM] fancy: gotcha
[4:45 PM] fancy: like what the actual fuck.
[4:48 PM] fancy: It's shame that generosity has become a bad thing.
[5:21 PM] fancy: Andrew, I want you to remember the conversation we had the other day about lines of logic and feelings.
[6:35 PM] fancy: and Subhanshu, wasn't it you who told me that if you can help someone, it's your responsibility to?
