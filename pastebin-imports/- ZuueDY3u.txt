Anonymous Berkeley Professor Shreds BLM Injustice Narrative; Berkel...
"Disgraceful..."

[11:02 PM] élégiaque: it references thomas sowell
[11:02 PM] élégiaque: useless letter
[11:03 PM] élégiaque: these types of arguments have been made a ton in the past specifically around the civil rights era
[11:04 PM] élégiaque: like why do we distinguish between race why not gender ect
[11:05 PM] élégiaque: tho I agree with the democrat thing
[11:06 PM] Cest:

[11:06 PM] Cest: @Master of Rampant Light
[11:06 PM] Cest: good start
[11:06 PM] predator: the point of that example is to explain why it's absurd to suggest the criminal justice system is racist when there are other examples that clearly explain there's more to it than external discrimination
[11:06 PM] élégiaque: yeah this letter is super dumb
[11:07 PM] predator: k
[11:07 PM] Master of Rampant Light: ye he has an autistic aura
[11:07 PM] Master of Rampant Light: it's god like
[11:07 PM] Master of Rampant Light: like an oblivion NPC
[11:07 PM] élégiaque: .

MLK would likely be called an Uncle Tom if he spoke on our campus today. We are training leaders who intend, explicitly, to destroy one of the only truly successful ethnically diverse societies in modern history. As the PRC, an ethnonationalist and aggressively racially chauvinist national polity with null immigration and no concept of jus solis increasingly presents itself as the global political alternative to the US, I ask you: Is this wise? Are we really doing the right thing?
[11:07 PM] élégiaque: this whole paragraph
[11:08 PM] predator: i dont agree with every suggestion btw
[11:08 PM] predator: he gets really preachy towards the end
[11:08 PM] élégiaque: there are other examples to explain discrimination but it still doesn't deter from the systematic racism black people have faced, it is a whole different conversation and it is moving the goal posts to bring the issue onto males themselves
[11:09 PM] predator: that isnt his intent with the example at all
[11:09 PM] predator: he's not suggesting male discrimination or anything of the sort as an alternative
[11:09 PM] Cest: autistic toilet enthusiast
[11:09 PM] Cest: admirable
[11:10 PM] predator: it's an example meant to demonstrate that systematic racism, even if it's a factor, is not the sole factor
[11:10 PM] predator: at least that's how i read it
[11:11 PM] predator: like you wouldnt suggest the criminal justice system is misogynistic because more men are incarcerated
[11:12 PM] élégiaque: They are intelligent scholars who reject a narrative that strips black people of agency and systematically externalizes the problems of the black community onto outsiders

 As an example of the latter problem, consider the proportion of black incarcerated Americans. This proportion is often used to characterize the criminal justice system as anti-black. However, if we use the precise same methodology, we would have to conclude that the criminal justice system is even more anti-male than it is anti-black.
[11:12 PM] predator: yea
[11:12 PM] predator: he's saying the logic is flawed
[11:14 PM] predator: if you apply the same logic to the question of race you see that it's possible for race to not be the core issue
[11:15 PM] élégiaque: but it isn't at all, a lot of crime simply is focused on males because of gender and cultural norms, the history of anti-black resentment and oppression is a clear explanation for their incarceration rates
[11:16 PM] shin: also the discrepancy in the harshness of sentencing across races
[11:16 PM] élégiaque: there has been a shit ton of historical studies specifically about black oppression and the prison system from the civil rights and post-80s era
[11:16 PM] predator: yea
[11:16 PM] predator: im not suggesting that it doesnt exist
[11:16 PM] predator: i dont think he suggests that either
[11:16 PM] predator: but this narrative
[11:16 PM] predator: points to 1 issue
[11:16 PM] predator: as the sole issue
[11:16 PM] élégiaque: no way man he cites thomas sowel and calls him good
[11:16 PM] predator: and there's no discussion to be had otherwise
[11:16 PM] élégiaque: yeah this is what I mean
[11:17 PM] élégiaque: its a classic move of the goal posts to discredit these movements
[11:17 PM] shin: the problem is that line of thinking he's presenting is a very common one used by people trying to invalidate the racial arguments
[11:17 PM] shin: like nano is saying
[11:17 PM] Renew: i want to tank
[11:17 PM] shin: i forget the term for this
[11:17 PM] shin: but there is one
[11:17 PM] shin: I wish I could remember
[11:18 PM] predator: from what i remember he criticizes the people he sent this letter to for not saying anything but also says he doesnt understand their circumstances and that they could lose their jobs for speaking out
[11:19 PM] shin: also there are definitely arguments for systematic biases against men in the judicial system
[11:19 PM] shin: in several areas
[11:19 PM] élégiaque: I just see this whole letter as a massive strawman
[11:19 PM] predator: you can say others intend to invalidate racial arguments but i dont read that in this letter at all
[11:20 PM] predator: he has a problem with the lack of dissent the movement necessitates
[11:20 PM] élégiaque: The claim that the difficulties that the black community faces are entirely causally explained by exogenous factors in the form of white systemic racism, white supremacy, and other forms of white discrimination remains a problematic hypothesis that should be vigorously challenged by historians
[11:20 PM] élégiaque: show me someone who thinks this
[11:20 PM] predator: if you dont see how that problem isnt unique to this movement i dont understand what else i could say
[11:20 PM] élégiaque: big use of the word
[11:20 PM] élégiaque: "entirely"
[11:21 PM] élégiaque: bro
[11:21 PM] shin: yeah that excerpt isnt' something you should say if you're trying to say "hey, yes, race is a problem, and there is also another problem we should talk about while we're at it"
[11:21 PM] shin: it's phrased in a deflective way
[11:21 PM] élégiaque: MLK would likely be called an Uncle Tom if he spoke on our campus today. We are training leaders who intend, explicitly, to destroy one of the only truly successful ethnically diverse societies in modern history. As the PRC, an ethnonationalist and aggressively racially chauvinist national polity with null immigration and no concept of jus solis increasingly presents itself as the global political alternative to the US, I ask you: Is this wise? Are we really doing the right thing?
[11:21 PM] predator: is that not what you hear among protests nano
[11:21 PM] élégiaque: he literally sets up a us-versus-them
[11:21 PM] élégiaque: argument
[11:22 PM] predator: i dont know if you've read the letter shin
[11:23 PM] predator: there isnt deflection from that issue
[11:23 PM] shin:
The claim that the difficulties that the black community faces are entirely causally explained by exogenous factors in the form of white systemic racism, white supremacy, and other forms of white discrimination remains a problematic hypothesis that should be vigorously challenged by historians
[11:23 PM] shin: this is
[11:23 PM] predator: and this question warrants more than a singular explanation
[11:23 PM] shin: this is 100% the rhetoric people use to try to deflect the conversation from talking about race
[11:23 PM] shin: it's harmful to the conversation
[11:24 PM] predator: what's more harmful to conversation? suggesting there are alternative causes?
[11:24 PM] élégiaque: I think thats a little anecdotal pred, if you could bring up major figures who are saying this (which funnily enough the letter doesn't) then maybe there would be worth in the dicussion
[11:24 PM] predator: i dont understand
[11:24 PM] Renew: black are inherently evil
[11:24 PM] shin: because this is not phrased in a way that's trying to say "here are even more problems that need to be tackled"
[11:25 PM] shin: it's minimizing the racial component
[11:25 PM] predator: yea it's anecdotal
[11:25 PM] élégiaque: yeah, the letter is creating a boogieman

[11:25 PM] predator: the issue is that blm isnt centralized
[11:25 PM] élégiaque: it screams neoconservativism
[11:25 PM] predator: people can interpret it in different ways
[11:25 PM] shin: this is like the logic of the all lives matter thing
[11:25 PM] shin: equally harmful
[11:27 PM] predator: even if it were deflective
[11:27 PM] élégiaque: there are plenty of black academic figures you could specifically argue against which the BLM has built on
[11:27 PM] predator: silencing all opposition isn't a way to go about identifying the issue
[11:27 PM] predator: or rendering an effective solution
[11:28 PM] élégiaque: ofc not but I don't think thats about the substance of the letter at all
[11:28 PM] élégiaque: its pretty easy to simply agree with that and see the wrong in it
[11:28 PM] shin: yeah if they were just trying to point out all the other problems that need to be addressed that also play a role
[11:28 PM] predator: you dont agree that he's primarily upset with the silencing of opposition?
[11:28 PM] shin: they would not use the language they did
[11:29 PM] élégiaque: yeah
[11:29 PM] shin: like
[11:29 PM] shin: not everything he says in this letter is wrong
[11:29 PM] shin: which is why it's so dangerous
[11:29 PM] Cest: lmao @Master of Rampant Light the old guys story about fucking with the cleaning lady when she was on the toilet
[11:29 PM] shin: I don't know what his intent was, but it doesn't really matter
[11:29 PM] Cest: little bastards
[11:29 PM] shin: because there's a responsibility when you're using a public platform
[11:29 PM] shin: to consider how your message is going to be received
[11:30 PM] predator: he was obviously aware of that
[11:30 PM] predator: seeing as the letter is anonymous
[11:30 PM] shin: so regardless of what he was trying to accomplish, he has used several wordings that are 100% harmful to the conversation
[11:30 PM] predator: and he understood the implications
[11:30 PM] predator: you dont understand
[11:30 PM] predator: there's no conversation
[11:30 PM] predator: that's the point of his letter
[11:30 PM] predator: and i see it as justified to attack the current discourse
[11:31 PM] élégiaque: the point of his letter is to create a boogieman to make the perception of there being no conversation to a strawman he has created
[11:31 PM] predator: when that discourse validates itself within itself
[11:32 PM] élégiaque: honestly im surprised a professor even wrote this
[11:32 PM] shin: also
[11:32 PM] élégiaque: it couldnt be
[11:32 PM] predator: i dont understand how it isnt abundantly clear there's a lack of discourse
[11:32 PM] shin:
Would we characterize criminal justice as a systemically misandrist conspiracy against innocent American men? I hope you see that this type of reasoning is flawed, and requires a significant suspension of our rational faculties.
[11:32 PM] shin: yes we would
[11:32 PM] shin: lol
[11:32 PM] shin: I mean there is a lack of discourse because no one in charge cares at all
[11:33 PM] predator: what
[11:33 PM] shin: and the majority of people don't care until there's a huge event
[11:33 PM] predator: the people in charge care for the lack of discourse
[11:33 PM] shin: no one cares about the day to day shit because it does'nt affect them
[11:33 PM] predator: this movement is political
[11:33 PM] élégiaque: idk what you mean by lack of discourse theres specifically a lot of conservative figures who make arguments like this all the time
[11:33 PM] shin: it just results in very little actual change
[11:34 PM] shin: because it's a societal problem, and most people don't care until it's an obvious extreme
[11:34 PM] predator: yea and what happens to them nano
[11:34 PM] predator: they become publicly condemned or something
[11:34 PM] predator: and if someone inside the movement itself
[11:34 PM] predator: presented possible dissent
[11:34 PM] predator: that person would be force to take sides
[11:34 PM] predator: forced
[11:34 PM] predator: that's not how it should be
[11:35 PM] élégiaque: they should tbh but they still do make the arguments
[11:36 PM] shin: there are lots of issues with the conversation, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist
[11:36 PM] predator: ofc
[11:36 PM] predator: there's some issue
[11:36 PM] predator: and discrimination of some kind
[11:36 PM] predator: let me find the part of the letter
[11:40 PM] shin: but saying things like:

The vast majority of violence visited on the black community is committed by black people. 

The claim that the difficulties that the black community faces are entirely causally explained by exogenous factors in the form of white systemic racism, white supremacy, and other forms of white discrimination remains a problematic hypothesis that should be vigorously challenged by historians.

If we claim that the criminal justice system is white-supremacist, why is it that Asian Americans, Indian Americans, and Nigerian Americans are incarcerated at vastly lower rates than white Americans?

Black people are not incarcerated at higher rates than their involvement in violent crime would predict.
[11:40 PM] shin: are all things that distract from what the conversation actually needs to be about
[11:40 PM] shin: these are all things that people who unironically think there is no problem use to defend their position
[11:40 PM] shin: he has lots of good points
[11:41 PM] shin: they are spoiled by these others
[11:41 PM] élégiaque: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fZQQ7o16yQ

Baldwin on Dick Cavett

[11:41 PM] predator: The ever-present soft bigotry of low expectations and the permanent claim that the solutions to the plight of my people rest exclusively on the goodwill of whites rather than on our own hard work is psychologically devastating. No other group in America is systematically demoralized in this way by its alleged allies.
[11:41 PM] élégiaque: nothing ever changes
[11:41 PM] shin: the first obstacle isn't 100% defining the problem and what exactly the proportions of each cause are
[11:41 PM] shin: the first obstacle is getting everyone to universally agree there is a problem
[11:41 PM] shin: we do not have that yet
[11:42 PM] predator: it's suggested in the thing you quoted as well that he's not ignorant of racially associated social plights
[11:42 PM] shin: I never said he didn't know about that
[11:42 PM] predator: The claim that the difficulties that the black community faces
[11:42 PM] shin: I said his phrasing and choice of rhetoric is poor
[11:42 PM] predator: shinToday at 11:36 PM
there are lots of issues with the conversation, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist
[11:42 PM] predator: he is not suggesting it doesnt exist
[11:42 PM] shin:
and he understood the implications
@predator
[11:43 PM] shin: hmm
[11:43 PM] élégiaque: that paragraph is dumb, because it isn't centeral that the solution rests """"exclusively""" on the GOODWILL of whites, but the abolition of the SYSTEM itself
[11:43 PM] shin: that did not quote how i wanted it to
[11:43 PM] shin:

[11:43 PM] élégiaque: thats what black thinkers actually write
[11:43 PM] élégiaque: like the whole abolish police and anti prison movement itself rests on that
[11:43 PM] élégiaque: its the recognition that its the system itself which is perpetuating the racism
[11:44 PM] shin: like nano said, the idea that the solution is for whites to "take care" of blacks through goodwill is equally harmful to actually solving the problem
[11:44 PM] élégiaque: this is why the letter is fucking retarded pred
[11:44 PM] shin: but the people who are actually advocating for these reforms, mostly, don't want that
[11:44 PM] élégiaque: it literally does not contain any dialogue with what black thinkers write about
[11:45 PM] predator: oh yea i said i didnt agree with everything and his rhetoric about the perspective of blm being rooted in a notion that its proponents must agree that white people exist to take care of blacks is one i disagree with
[11:45 PM] shin: but like I said, we can't solve the details before the problem is even universally acknowledged
[11:45 PM] shin: that's why this letter is harmful
[11:45 PM] shin: it's tryign to talk about phase 2 when we haven't even finished phase 1
[11:46 PM] shin: but when you're talking in the context of public discourse, nuance often gets turned into a way to deflect the problem
[11:46 PM] predator: i dont understand when those phases begin or end or what their criteria are
[11:46 PM] shin: this happens time and time again
[11:46 PM] predator: if it isnt the principle factor it simply isnt
[11:46 PM] shin: you have to get everyone to accept there is a problem

[11:46 PM] predator: and i dont believe it is
[11:46 PM] shin: before you talk about the details of the problem
[11:46 PM] shin: phase 1, phase 2
[11:46 PM] predator: nor does the person writing this letter
[11:46 PM] predator: and they should be free to voice that
[11:46 PM] predator: and yet they are not
[11:46 PM] shin: you can voice whatever you want that doesn't make you right and it doesn't make your contribution not harmful
[11:46 PM] predator: not in this current movement
[11:46 PM] élégiaque: is that the only thing you brought up the letter about then?
[11:46 PM] élégiaque: like him not being able to voice the opinion
[11:47 PM] predator: that's very important to blm and to the letter itself yea
[11:47 PM] predator: it isnt the only thing
[11:47 PM] predator: i dont agree that race is a central motivator in whatever discrimination is occurring
[11:47 PM] predator: the letter agrees with that as well
[11:48 PM] shin: I don't think that line of thinking is supported by reality at all
[11:48 PM] shin: but ok
[11:48 PM] élégiaque: it depends on how you see motivation
[11:48 PM] élégiaque: race certainly has played a role historically and still plays a role due to this history
[11:49 PM] élégiaque: you don't need to go far to look for examples of specifically targted racial policies
[11:49 PM] élégiaque: especially when there is an economic justification for it
[11:50 PM] élégiaque: you can't really just say op ok 400 years of oppression none of that exists anymore
[11:50 PM] Master of Rampant Light: Absolute rascal @Cest
[11:50 PM] Master of Rampant Light: UK doc's are too comfy
[11:50 PM] predator: if you're so sure of the reality then you must also understand why it's frustrating for those who present dissenting opinion to try and have a conversation with people who believe their perspective is the insoluble reality shin
[11:51 PM] predator: also yea nano ur right
[11:51 PM] shin: you're missing the point
[11:51 PM] shin: this is the same issue that "All Lives Matter" has
[11:52 PM] shin: but regardless, I don't think there is a sound or valid argument for saying that racial bias isn't a very large factor in today's society
[11:53 PM] shin: which is why I say I don't think that line of thinking is supported by reality
[11:53 PM] predator: i just cant agree with the position that this argument, this absolute reality that is racial discrimination, is worth the sacrifice of discourse itself, for that sentiment to portray its effects
[11:54 PM] élégiaque: I really don't think the argument is in good faith or concise, there would be no way that something along these lines could clear any peer-review
[11:54 PM] predator: in a situation that i think is plenty in nuance
[11:55 PM] predator: idc about peer review
[11:55 PM] élégiaque: I don't really see any worth in it to care tbh, there are arguments against these issues but I don't think this is one of them at all
[11:56 PM] élégiaque: in the case where there was an actual good faith working then I would be more than fine with it
[11:57 PM] predator: in the letter? i think he operates on good faith in the context of establishing discourse
[11:57 PM] predator: im not sure about the lower rhetoric though
[11:57 PM] predator: like i said
[11:57 PM] élégiaque: I really don't at all but I want to play ffxiv and stop typing
[11:58 PM] predator: rofl
[11:58 PM] élégiaque: sry
[11:58 PM] -w-: this was so cute
[11:58 PM] élégiaque: we can continue another time
[11:58 PM] predator: it is o k
