[9:20 PM] A Random Badger: all
[9:20 PM] A Random Badger: very
[9:20 PM] A Random Badger: bad
[9:20 PM] A Random Badger: ty
[9:20 PM] fancy: uh huh
[9:20 PM] A Random Badger: i mean i think fireworks are just more obnoxious than not
[9:20 PM] A Random Badger: xd
[9:21 PM] A Random Badger: and i've never been able to stand loud noises since i was a child
[9:21 PM] A Random Badger: so
[9:21 PM] A Random Badger: i have a bias
[9:21 PM] A Random Badger: lol
[9:21 PM] fancy: yeah
[9:21 PM] fancy: it's called
[9:21 PM] fancy: being edgy
[9:21 PM] A Random Badger: sure
[9:21 PM] A Random Badger: xd
[9:22 PM] fancy: I mean hating on stuff just cus you don't personally lik eit
[9:22 PM] fancy: is basically the definition of edgy
[9:22 PM] fancy: just be positive
[9:22 PM] fancy: why not
[9:23 PM] A Random Badger: uh i mean, im not tkaing it away from other people, and advocating against it, i just personally find them very unenjoyable
[9:23 PM] fancy: I didn't say you're oppressing people with ur authoritarian state
[9:23 PM] fancy: I said you're being edgy
[9:24 PM] A Random Badger: i dont really understand the definition then
[9:24 PM] A Random Badger: because in that case
[9:24 PM] A Random Badger: not liking something
[9:24 PM] A Random Badger: that is widely liked
[9:24 PM] A Random Badger: is being edgy
[9:24 PM] A Random Badger: ?
[9:24 PM] A Random Badger: or is reliant on the
[9:24 PM] A Random Badger: widely liked part
[9:24 PM] A Random Badger: ?
[9:24 PM] fancy: https://puu.sh/DOPOF/812c84d41c.png

[9:24 PM] fancy: this is edgy
[9:25 PM] A Random Badger: so the act of voicing that dislike?
[9:25 PM] A Random Badger: i mean im just trying to understand
[9:25 PM] A Random Badger: the meaning
[9:25 PM] fancy: there's a difference between
[9:25 PM] A Random Badger: behind it
[9:25 PM] fancy: saying
[9:25 PM] fancy: I don't really like something
[9:25 PM] fancy: vs
[9:25 PM] fancy: exaggerating it
[9:25 PM] A Random Badger: ok so its the exaggeration then that makes it edgy?
[9:26 PM] A Random Badger: gotcha
[9:32 PM] A Random Badger: my main problem with fireworks in particular tho isn't necessarily the fireworks themselves but when people misuse them. like at my moms old house we had a very irresponsible neighbor decide to shoot fireworks right above our house way past the borough's time restriction on when fireworks can be used, which for one was dangerous because they didn't know what they were doing and 2 just a real dick move cause they knew we had small kids and decided to extend their fun anyways at the neighborhood's expense. other than i don't find much of a problem with them anymore
[9:33 PM] fancy: your problem is with people
[9:33 PM] fancy: not with fireworks
[9:33 PM] fancy: lol
[9:33 PM] A Random Badger: i mean i also personally don't like fireworks
[9:33 PM] A Random Badger: but yea
[9:33 PM] A Random Badger: mainly the people
[9:34 PM] A Random Badger: to which in my experience, most people tend to go overboard with fireworks to the point of them becoming a disturbance imo
[9:34 PM] fancy: well
[9:34 PM] fancy: no
[9:34 PM] fancy: that's a biased sample set
[9:34 PM] fancy: by design
[9:34 PM] fancy: because you wouldn't notice people that don't go overboard
[9:36 PM] A Random Badger: yea true
[9:37 PM] A Random Badger: that's ofc true duh because im not realizing the people who don't go overboard because they're not lol
[9:37 PM] A Random Badger: so yea wrong of me to say most people
[9:39 PM] A Random Badger: i just find it extremely annoying when people aren't respectful and misuse them, perhaps more annoyed than others might become because i have a bias against fireworks in the first place
