10:29 PM - broken: I felt really let down
10:29 PM - broken: the other night
10:30 PM - broken: and idk
10:30 PM - broken: it just felt
10:30 PM - broken: really bad I guess
10:30 PM - broken: that no one stood up for me
10:30 PM - broken: when sean was being a dick to me
10:40 PM - Leniea: Sorry that it happened
10:40 PM - Leniea: :/
10:40 PM - Leniea: I don't generally get in between people that argue about dota
10:40 PM - Leniea: cuz I dont get that passionate about it
10:40 PM - broken: I mean that part was okay
10:40 PM - broken: but like
10:40 PM - Leniea: so I dont even know what you guys were arguing about
10:40 PM - broken: he was also just being a general asshole
10:40 PM - broken: in the things he said
10:40 PM - Leniea: to be honest I have no idea why either of you guys were tilting
10:41 PM - broken: like I'm okay if you don't get involved in the dota part
10:41 PM - broken: but he was just a complete dick
10:41 PM - Leniea: yeah
10:41 PM - Leniea: i dunno when that happens
10:41 PM - Leniea: i recommend muting
10:41 PM - broken: I mean that's one thing when it's soem randy
10:41 PM - broken: but like
10:41 PM - broken: idk
10:41 PM - broken: it was just like
10:41 PM - broken: i thought i had friends there
10:41 PM - broken: and literally no one spoke up
10:41 PM - broken: to be like hey
10:41 PM - broken: chill
10:49 PM - Leniea: WTF
10:49 PM - Leniea: i told you guys
10:49 PM - Leniea: to cool it
10:49 PM - broken: that's not the same
10:49 PM - broken: as telling him
10:49 PM - broken: that he was being an ass
10:49 PM - Leniea: Idk like you guys both argued
10:49 PM - Leniea: it was stupid of both of youi
10:50 PM - broken: except the difference was
10:50 PM - broken: i didn't call him a bad person
10:50 PM - broken: or criticize his character
10:50 PM - broken: he did
10:50 PM - broken: did you hear the shit he was saying?
10:51 PM - Leniea: yes
10:51 PM - Leniea: fancy I care about you but
10:51 PM - broken: like arguing i sone thing
10:51 PM - Leniea: if anyone ever starts to argue with you about dota
10:51 PM - broken: I can argue with people and not get upset
10:51 PM - Leniea: you should really just mute them
10:51 PM - Leniea: even if we are on the same discord server
10:51 PM - broken: I don't think you're understanding why i was upset
10:51 PM - broken: I'm not upset that he was wrong
10:51 PM - broken: i'm upset that he was a dick to me and no one called him out
10:51 PM - Leniea: you realized he was an ass
10:52 PM - Leniea: yes we could have stood up for you
10:52 PM - Leniea: and none of us agree with what happened
10:52 PM - Leniea: but you cant let people say shit like that to you
10:52 PM - Leniea: i made you an admin
10:52 PM - Leniea: you could fucking kick him
10:52 PM - broken: but like
10:52 PM - broken: if no one else says anything
10:52 PM - broken: my understanding
10:52 PM - broken: is that you all think what he's doing is okay
10:53 PM - Leniea: like you also understand like
10:53 PM - Leniea: he was our friend
10:53 PM - Leniea: also
10:53 PM - broken: yes
10:53 PM - Leniea: at some point
10:53 PM - broken: I do
10:53 PM - broken: that's why
10:53 PM - broken: I didn't kick him
10:53 PM - Leniea: so it's not up to us to try to pick sides
10:53 PM - broken: or do anything
10:53 PM - broken: it really is
10:53 PM - broken: if someone is being a dick to someone
10:53 PM - broken: that you care about
10:54 PM - Leniea: i mean you are saying it like
10:54 PM - Leniea: we didnt care at all
10:54 PM - Leniea: you are both our friends
10:54 PM - Leniea: like i dont agree with what he says
10:54 PM - Leniea: but im also not going to tell him to stop
10:54 PM - Leniea: you let him insult you just kick him
10:55 PM - Leniea: just 1v1 him
10:55 PM - broken: sigh
10:56 PM - Leniea: you need some time
10:56 PM - Leniea: but you have to let it go
10:56 PM - Leniea: after a while
10:56 PM - Leniea: we dont dislike you
10:56 PM - Leniea: but we also cant be your savior when it comes to that
10:56 PM - broken: I will get over it eventually
10:56 PM - Leniea: that was just one instance
10:56 PM - Leniea: we didnt think it was that serious
10:56 PM - broken: bu ti'm still going to be disappointed
10:56 PM - broken: that my friends
10:56 PM - broken: didn't have my back
10:56 PM - Leniea: the entire thing was just super childish
10:56 PM - Leniea: we didnt think much of it at all
10:57 PM - broken: clearly

10:58 PM - Leniea: this is so freaking stupid like
10:58 PM - Leniea: i dont understand like
10:58 PM - Leniea: we honestly thought it was like not a big deal at all because none of us even understood you guys were fighting
10:58 PM - Leniea: we didnt process it until the moment sean said you were gonna go jerk off later
10:58 PM - Leniea: and at that point the argument was like 85% completed
10:58 PM - Leniea: and we were all just like
10:58 PM - Leniea: wtf is going on
10:58 PM - Leniea: and not only that it takes us like some time to fucking concentrate on the actual gam e

10:59 PM - Leniea: Okay
10:59 PM - Leniea: you can be hurt
10:59 PM - Leniea: that's fine
10:59 PM - Leniea: but you can't shift the blame onto us like it was our fault
10:59 PM - broken: nothing was your fault
10:59 PM - broken: that's not what I said
10:59 PM - broken: it wasn't right or wrong for you to say nothing
11:00 PM - broken: I just thought I was respected enough that you guys would have my back, but that's not the case
11:00 PM - broken: and that's also okay
11:00 PM - broken: I'm just sad about that
11:00 PM - Leniea: see
11:00 PM - Leniea: you are blaming us
11:00 PM - broken: that's not blame
11:00 PM - Leniea: for not respecting you
11:00 PM - broken: I'm not tellin gyou
11:00 PM - broken: you did something wrong
11:00 PM - Leniea: i actually dont respect the fact that you would expect us to stand up for you in a situation so completely retarded
11:00 PM - Leniea: i'm literally fuming
11:00 PM - broken: I mean
11:01 PM - broken: to me that just means you don't care how i feel
11:01 PM - broken: because he was being an ass to me
11:01 PM - broken: and it made me sad
11:01 PM - broken: but if you think
11:01 PM - broken: I shouldn' thave been sad
11:01 PM - broken: then fine
11:01 PM - broken: that's that I guess
11:01 PM - Leniea: its fucking fine
11:01 PM - Leniea: for you to be sad
11:01 PM - Leniea: but its bullshit
11:01 PM - Leniea: for you to start to blame us for it
11:01 PM - broken: I'm not
11:01 PM - Leniea: even putting any blame at all is unfair
11:01 PM - broken: blaming you
11:01 PM - Leniea: you say that
11:01 PM - Leniea: but you say you are upset we dont respect you
11:01 PM - Leniea: and thats just complete fucking bullshit
11:01 PM - broken: I said I though you guys would have my back in that situation
