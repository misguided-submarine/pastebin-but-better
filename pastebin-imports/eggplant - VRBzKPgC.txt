1:17 PM] HaxJester: hmm, suddenly had a shower thought moment about the idea of people understanding their motivation thing that we talked about like way back
[1:19 PM] HaxJester: aite cool, there are massive research on this too
[1:19 PM] HaxJester: so I know I'm probably on the right track
[1:19 PM] HaxJester: you ever heard of situational and individual interest?
[1:27 PM] fancy: not in those terms but I might know the underlying concepts
[1:28 PM] HaxJester: basically meaning address the situation vs address what is to come
[1:30 PM] fancy: http://www.opentextbooks.org.hk/ditatopic/6272
[1:30 PM] fancy: ok I read this
[1:30 PM] fancy: god bless hong kong
[1:30 PM] fancy: lol
[1:31 PM] HaxJester: uhh
[1:31 PM] HaxJester: that says
[1:32 PM] HaxJester: personal interests instead of individual interests
[1:32 PM] HaxJester: it also explained it as something completely different
[1:32 PM] HaxJester: it basically says
[1:32 PM] HaxJester: your students are half committed to the situation of being in the class and half committed to what they imagine they could be doing
[1:33 PM] fancy: isn't that more or less the same
[1:33 PM] HaxJester: not really
[1:33 PM] HaxJester: so that last line is for personal interests vs situational interests
[1:34 PM] HaxJester: individual interests vs situational interests are more like
[1:35 PM] HaxJester: your students are half committed to the situation of being in the class and half committed to a more macro goal of, say satisfying their parents
[1:37 PM] HaxJester: and it's a pretty big deal, cus this thing leads to enhancements and disinterests depending on if they agree or disagree
[1:38 PM] fancy:
your students are half committed to the situation of being in the class
[1:38 PM] fancy: I feel like this is too vague
[1:38 PM] fancy: to definitely say that it's in opposition to either
[1:38 PM] fancy:
satisfying their parents
[1:38 PM] fancy: or
[1:38 PM] HaxJester: it's meant to be vage
[1:38 PM] fancy:
what they imagine they could be doing
[1:38 PM] fancy: well no I mean like
[1:39 PM] fancy: "being committed to a class"
[1:39 PM] fancy: could be any of those forms of interest
[1:39 PM] HaxJester: it's to address 2 simultaneous interest that an individual would be facing in the situation
[1:39 PM] fancy: like what the article I read described, to my understanding, was not what you summarized
[1:39 PM] HaxJester: alright, what did your article say?
[1:41 PM] fancy: it said this is situational interests:
Situational interests are ones that are triggered temporarily by features of the immediate situation

and this is personal interests:
Personal interests are relatively permanent preferences of the student, and are usually expressed in a variety of situations. In the classroom, a student may (or may not) have a personal interest in particular topics, activities, or subject matter. Outside class, though, he or she usually has additional personal interests in particular non-academic activities (e.g. sports, music) or even in particular people (a celebrity, a friend who lives nearby). The non-academic personal interests may sometimes conflict with academic interest; it may be more interesting to go to the shopping mall with a friend than to study even your most favorite subject.

I don't think the dichotomy in the latter part was saying "being in class was the situational interest vs the personal interest of doing literally anything else"
[1:41 PM] fancy: I think the last half was saying "there can be conflict among one's personal interests"
[1:42 PM] HaxJester: how is your analysis different from what I said about "your students are half committed to the situation of being in the class and half committed to what they imagine they could be doing?"
[1:42 PM] fancy: because you said
so that last line is for personal interests vs situational interests

which I understood to be referencing that line
[1:42 PM] HaxJester: yeah
[1:42 PM] fancy: which I don't think is true
[1:42 PM] fancy: I don't think that's what it was saying
[1:43 PM] HaxJester: so your source is referencing personal vs situational
[1:43 PM] HaxJester: is it not?
[1:43 PM] fancy: the thing I read described what situational interests are and what personal interests are
[1:43 PM] fancy: but the example it gave when describing personal interests didn't involve situational ones
[1:43 PM] HaxJester: yes, they're two things
[1:44 PM] fancy: so it's not
that last line is for personal interests vs situational interests
[1:44 PM] fancy: was my point
[1:44 PM] HaxJester: so in my explanation of "your students are half committed to the situation of being in the class and half committed to what they imagine they could be doing"
the personal half is what they could be doing
and the situational half is what is going on in the class
[1:44 PM] fancy: not necessarily
[1:44 PM] HaxJester: is this not how the two are being explained in the excerpt?
[1:44 PM] fancy: no
[1:44 PM] fancy: it's not
[1:44 PM] HaxJester: so how is it being explained?
[1:45 PM] fancy: it's comparing the personal interest of "oh hey this class subject is interesting" with the non-academic personal interest of "hey I really like shopping"
[1:45 PM] fancy: two broad goals, where one takes precedence over the other
[1:46 PM] fancy: as opposed to you happened to be in a class and it started to sound interesting but you really wish you were somewhere else
[1:46 PM] HaxJester: oh, you're reading specifically about the possibilities on the personal interest
[1:46 PM] HaxJester: alright
[1:46 PM] HaxJester: I'm gonna bring you a step back
[1:46 PM] fancy: which is why I said just saying "half committed to being in class" is too vague
[1:46 PM] HaxJester: what's the situational interest in the situation here?
[1:46 PM] fancy: because there's a million reasons that you can be "half committed to being in a class"
[1:46 PM] fancy: like you can say that about all of the following:
[1:47 PM] HaxJester: hang on
[1:47 PM] HaxJester: this might answer what you're thinking about
[1:47 PM] HaxJester: what's the situational interest in the situation here?
[1:47 PM] fancy: 1. person has an interest in being in class because they want good grades
2. person has an interest in pleasing their parents
3. person happened to be in class and professor said something that piqued their interest and now they're interested
4. person actually enjoys the subject in general
[1:47 PM] fancy: etc
[1:48 PM] fancy: 3 of those are personal interests and one of those is a situational one
[1:48 PM] fancy: at least from what I'm understanding about what I'm reading
[1:48 PM] HaxJester: well you still haven't answered my question tbh, so I dunno how we're gonna move forward here
[1:48 PM] fancy: what situation
[1:48 PM] HaxJester: the situation in the example
[1:48 PM] fancy: it wasn't involved in the example
[1:49 PM] fancy:
In the classroom, a student may (or may not) have a personal interest in particular topics, activities, or subject matter. Outside class, though, he or she usually has additional personal interests in particular non-academic activities (e.g. sports, music) or even in particular people (a celebrity, a friend who lives nearby). The non-academic personal interests may sometimes conflict with academic interest; it may be more interesting to go to the shopping mall with a friend than to study even your most favorite subject.
[1:49 PM] fancy: this was the whole example
[1:49 PM] HaxJester: yes, the example is
[1:49 PM] HaxJester: a student in the class
[1:49 PM] HaxJester: the situation is that
[1:49 PM] HaxJester: the student in the class
[1:49 PM] HaxJester: thus as far as the situational interests part in your interest model goes
[1:49 PM] HaxJester: it's the class
[1:50 PM] fancy: what
[1:50 PM] HaxJester: wait
[1:50 PM] HaxJester: have you read up about
[1:50 PM] HaxJester: what is the situational interest?
[1:50 PM] fancy:
Situational interests are ones that are triggered temporarily by features of the immediate situation. Unusual sights, sounds, or words can stimulate situational interest. A teacher might show an interesting image on the overhead projector, or play a brief bit of music, or make a surprising comment in passing. At a more abstract level, unusual or surprising topics of discussion can also arouse interest when they are first introduced.
[1:50 PM] HaxJester: yes
[1:50 PM] fancy:
Situational interest is generated by particular conditions and/or objects in the environment. Such interest involves focused attention and an affective reaction that may or may not last (Hidi 1990). Although the affective reaction associated with situational interest tends to be positive, negative emotions may also be involved in experiencing interest (Hidi and Harackiewicz 2000).
[1:50 PM] fancy: etc
[1:50 PM] HaxJester: so the things that goes on in the class
[1:51 PM] HaxJester: so generally put
[1:51 PM] HaxJester: it's the class, is it not?
[1:51 PM] fancy: yes that may or may not happen
[1:51 PM] fancy: it did not happen in the context of that example though
[1:51 PM] fancy: like that wasn't what the example was illustrating
[1:51 PM] HaxJester: well, in the case of it happening less, it holds less control over what you'll do
[1:51 PM] HaxJester: which is what I mean by
[1:51 PM] HaxJester: well half is kinda a general way to put it
[1:52 PM] HaxJester: cus #1 -- it could be weighed differently, nobody is always splitting 50/50
#2 -- your personal interest aren't necessarily separate from your situational interests
[1:53 PM] HaxJester: but to put it in the general sense, this source is giving a split of half to situational, half to personal
[1:53 PM] fancy: my source?
[1:53 PM] HaxJester: yeah
[1:53 PM] fancy: no
[1:53 PM] fancy: what
[1:53 PM] HaxJester: ok how is it splitting a person's intersts?
[1:53 PM] fancy: like a person in general?
[1:54 PM] fancy: I don't think is being descriptive of "here is all the possible interests of a person"
[1:54 PM] HaxJester: whatever your source explains
[1:54 PM] fancy: I'm pretty sure it's jsut saying "here are two kinds of interest"
[1:54 PM] HaxJester: well yes, nothing in psychology ever will be
[1:55 PM] HaxJester: it's always about how there are a few components that cover up the majority
[1:55 PM] HaxJester: and in this case, would you not say that the listed components are "personal interest" and "situational interest"?
[1:56 PM] fancy: sure
[1:56 PM] fancy: those are the two things that paragraph talks about
[1:57 PM] HaxJester: aite what I was saying was that your source, being about student motivation in the education field, rather than general motivation
[1:57 PM] HaxJester: splits it that way
[1:57 PM] HaxJester: which says what they're looking at vs what they want to do
[1:58 PM] fancy:
which says what they're looking at vs what they want to do
this is zoomed out way too vague again
[1:58 PM] HaxJester: I was asking about situational vs individual
[1:58 PM] fancy: in what context
[1:58 PM] fancy: like

[1:58 PM] HaxJester: which says what they're looking at vs what they hope to achieve
[1:58 PM] fancy: original question?
[1:59 PM] HaxJester: I'm zooming out cus I'm saying your source doesn't address what I was talking about
[1:59 PM] fancy: also what's the diff between "what they want to do" with "what they hope to achieve"
[1:59 PM] fancy: imo they're the same
[1:59 PM] HaxJester: well
[1:59 PM] HaxJester: your source is explaining personal interests as activities that they're looking to do or planning to do
[2:00 PM] HaxJester: so I can use an example that they gave of playing sports
[2:00 PM] fancy: not entirely
[2:00 PM] HaxJester: individual interest looks more at a macro goal of, say, impressing their parents
[2:00 PM] HaxJester: ??
[2:00 PM] HaxJester: it's right in your excerpt
[2:00 PM] HaxJester: wdym not entirely?
[2:01 PM] fancy:
In the classroom, a student may (or may not) have a personal interest in particular topics, activities, or subject matter. Outside class, though, he or she usually has additional personal interests in particular non-academic activities (e.g. sports, music) or even in particular people (a celebrity, a friend who lives nearby). The non-academic personal interests may sometimes conflict with academic interest; it may be more interesting to go to the shopping mall with a friend than to study even your most favorite subject.
[2:02 PM] fancy: topics, activies, subject matter
[2:02 PM] fancy: as well as people
[2:02 PM] HaxJester: so how does that disqualify "playing sports" as an example of personal interest?
[2:02 PM] HaxJester: you're citing but you're not providing explanations
[2:02 PM] fancy: it doesn't, I didn't say it did
[2:03 PM] fancy: I just said it's not entirely just "things they're planning on doing"
[2:03 PM] fancy: but you also haven't answered what the difference is
[2:03 PM] fancy: between
[2:03 PM] fancy: "things someone wants to do"
[2:03 PM] fancy: and "things one hopes to achieve"
[2:03 PM] HaxJester: yeah, I was getting to that, then someone keeps raising trivial claims about how it doesn't apply when it does
[2:03 PM] HaxJester: :poppo:
[2:04 PM] HaxJester: aite so
[2:04 PM] HaxJester: take 4
[2:05 PM] HaxJester: situational interest = attending class
personal interests = playing sports
individual interests = impressing parents
[2:05 PM] HaxJester: this is the example I'm using to include the scope of your source
[2:05 PM] HaxJester: these are also all valid examples of each category btw
[2:06 PM] HaxJester: attending class is the situational interest because that's the situation the person in the example is in
[2:06 PM] HaxJester: playing sports is the personal interest because that is what the person in the example is interested in doing
[2:07 PM] HaxJester: so on the situational vs personal scope, it will say that this person will not pay attention in class, because you can't collaborate the personal interest here to the situational interest for the person in question
[2:08 PM] HaxJester: impressing parents is the individual interest because that is the macro goal that the person wants to achieve
[2:09 PM] HaxJester: so on the situational vs individual scope, it will say that this person can be convinced to be more interested in class because there is agreement between these 2
[2:09 PM] HaxJester: and on top of that, individual interest level stuff are determinants of situational interest unless challenged
[2:10 PM] HaxJester: so the person will be convinced to be interested in class until they're convinced to, say, the confirmation bias number of 95%, that their individual interest of impressing their parents is no longer something that they would uphold
[2:10 PM] fancy: aite you're gonna have to explain what makes something a personal interest vs an individual interest
[2:10 PM] fancy: because we still fundamentally aren't on the same page
[2:12 PM] HaxJester: kinda like the what you're doing and why you're doing it
[2:12 PM] HaxJester: like, you run Teo (personal) because you want to be perceived as a competent player (individual)
[2:13 PM] HaxJester: you can't just became a competent player by doing the action of being competent
[2:13 PM] fancy: I'm not seeing the distinction here
[2:13 PM] HaxJester: ok, what would you do if I told you to get good
[2:14 PM] fancy: realistically, or in the context of humouring the example
[2:14 PM] HaxJester: like, what specific action
[2:14 PM] HaxJester: no, like, I'm telling you to just get good by doing something
[2:14 PM] fancy: kek
[2:14 PM] HaxJester: what is the something you'll do
[2:14 PM] fancy: ok so as an aside that didn't address my tongue-in-cheek comment
[2:14 PM] fancy: lol
[2:15 PM] fancy: but
[2:15 PM] fancy: to answer the question
[2:15 PM] HaxJester: it apply for both of what you addressed btw
[2:15 PM] fancy: what
[2:15 PM] fancy: no
[2:15 PM] fancy: realistically I would do nothing
[2:15 PM] fancy: because idgaf
[2:15 PM] HaxJester: it's a realistic example and it's a humoring context
[2:15 PM] HaxJester: I mean sure
[2:15 PM] HaxJester: ok even that works
[2:16 PM] fancy: but if you want to illustrate an example of "based on X goal, what is the appropriate action you'd take"
[2:16 PM] fancy: then that's not very useful
[2:16 PM] fancy: because it reduces it to "i do what I want because I don't care what other people think"
[2:16 PM] HaxJester: your individual interest here is that you're disinterested in external perception
[2:16 PM] HaxJester: yes
[2:16 PM] HaxJester: so that statement you just made
[2:16 PM] HaxJester: that's your individual interest
[2:16 PM] HaxJester: it's not something you can actually do
[2:16 PM] HaxJester: but it's an end goal that you're aiming to achieve
[2:16 PM] fancy: and you're trying to make a disctintion between "I want goal x, therefor I want to do action y, which achieves goal x." and saying that the interest in X and Y are fundamentally different
[2:16 PM] fancy: at least is my understanding
[2:17 PM] fancy: of what you're trying to say
[2:17 PM] fancy: wait
[2:17 PM] HaxJester: it's like
[2:17 PM] fancy: wait
[2:17 PM] fancy:
it's not something you can actually do
[2:17 PM] HaxJester: well
[2:17 PM] HaxJester: wording I guess
[2:17 PM] fancy: I don't agree with this
[2:17 PM] HaxJester: as far as the distinction between personal and individual goes
[2:18 PM] HaxJester: the personal part refers to the actions that you can actually do
[2:18 PM] fancy: it sounds like you're just calling personal interests the individual components of achieving a larger goal
[2:18 PM] HaxJester: the individual refers to the outcome that you can't achieve without doing other actions
[2:18 PM] HaxJester: I mean, you can say that
[2:18 PM] HaxJester: and it would work
[2:18 PM] fancy: I personally wouldn't consider those distinct
[2:18 PM] HaxJester: but this kinda tie into that motivation thing
[2:19 PM] HaxJester: like, different degrees of interest in this case
[2:19 PM] fancy: idk about degree
[2:19 PM] fancy: depending on what you mean by that, I don't think I'd agree, personally
[2:19 PM] fancy: cus like here maybe I can explain my philosophy about this
[2:19 PM] fancy: so like
[2:19 PM] fancy: say you have some large goal
[2:19 PM] fancy: like
[2:20 PM] fancy: "I want to have a phd"
[2:20 PM] HaxJester: ok
[2:20 PM] HaxJester: first
[2:20 PM] fancy: obviously you can't just go have a phd
[2:20 PM] HaxJester: what kind of interest is that?
[2:20 PM] HaxJester: personal, situational, or individual?
[2:20 PM] fancy: doesn't matter idc labels now I'm explaining something
[2:20 PM] HaxJester: aite
[2:20 PM] fancy: so like
[2:20 PM] fancy: say that's a goal
[2:20 PM] HaxJester: but it's important here
[2:20 PM] fancy: but then
[2:20 PM] HaxJester: cus that's a personal interest
[2:20 PM] fancy: ok
[2:20 PM] HaxJester: cus you go to school and get a PhD
[2:20 PM] fancy: name what you think is an individual interest

[2:21 PM] fancy: and I can use that instead
[2:21 PM] HaxJester: it's something you can physically do and doesn't define your macro, personal goal
[2:21 PM] HaxJester: the example is "be respected"
[2:21 PM] fancy: so overall goal is "be respected"
[2:21 PM] HaxJester: yes
[2:21 PM] fancy: and obviously you can't just go do that in an afternoon
[2:21 PM] fancy: just like you can't get a phd in an afternoon
[2:22 PM] HaxJester: well, no, you can't just go and "be respected"
[2:22 PM] fancy: I disagree
[2:22 PM] fancy: you can definitely do things to achieve that
[2:22 PM] HaxJester: ok, what would you do
[2:22 PM] fancy: just like you can do things to achieve a phd
[2:22 PM] fancy: you have to break it down just like you'd break down a phd
[2:22 PM] HaxJester: is a PhD something you physically can have?
[2:22 PM] fancy: no
[2:22 PM] HaxJester: why not?
[2:22 PM] fancy: i mean if you're talking about the piece of paper
[2:22 PM] fancy: sure
[2:22 PM] HaxJester: exactly
[2:23 PM] fancy: but that's not what a phd is
[2:23 PM] HaxJester: you can go to the school and write the paper
[2:23 PM] HaxJester: you get the PhD
[2:23 PM] fancy: you can't physically have it
[2:23 PM] fancy: it's a concept
[2:23 PM] fancy: just like respect
[2:23 PM] HaxJester: you can have a certificate for it
[2:23 PM] fancy: that's meaningless
[2:23 PM] HaxJester: that's as tangible as it gets
[2:23 PM] fancy: i'm not talking about the piece of paper
[2:23 PM] fancy: lol
[2:23 PM] HaxJester: what kind of tangible accreditation would you get for "being respected?"
[2:24 PM] fancy: if someone gave you a piece of paper that says "I respect you" that's as tangibly useful as the paper that says "you have a phd"
[2:24 PM] fancy: it's not about the paper, it's about what the paper represents
[2:24 PM] HaxJester: if a homeless guy on the street hands you a piece of paper that says "I respect you", would you say you feel respected?
[2:24 PM] fancy: no, but I also woudln't think I had a phd if he handed me one
[2:25 PM] HaxJester: why would he hand you one
[2:25 PM] fancy: why would he hand me a piece of paper that says "I respect you"
[2:25 PM] HaxJester: a PhD already restricts the institutions to certified universities
[2:25 PM] HaxJester: but anyone can write down "I respect you" on a piece of paper and hand it to you
[2:26 PM] fancy: so you're hung up on the fact that there's some institution that moderates PHD's
[2:26 PM] fancy: as why they're tangible
[2:26 PM] HaxJester: does a PhD graduate not state the institution they receive it from?
[2:26 PM] fancy: hmm
[2:26 PM] fancy: I don't think you're seeing my point
[2:26 PM] fancy: lemme think
[2:26 PM] HaxJester: well, would the paper state it? yes or no?
[2:27 PM] HaxJester: cus that's a vital part of a PhD
[2:27 PM] HaxJester: what field of study it's in, and what institution you got it from
[2:27 PM] HaxJester: a piece of paper that says "I respect you" has none of those validations
[2:27 PM] fancy: so
[2:27 PM] fancy: it doesn't have those because it isn't a societal convention
[2:28 PM] fancy: so what my original point was
[2:28 PM] fancy: is that it's not the physical phd that is valuable
[2:28 PM] fancy: it's what the paper represents
[2:28 PM] HaxJester: so because the PhD includes these validations, you're already establishing the criteria of what you need to do
[2:28 PM] HaxJester: and that is
[2:29 PM] HaxJester: fulfill the course/research requirement as per the institution
[2:29 PM] HaxJester: this is the entire basis behind what the paper represents
[2:29 PM] fancy: so do you think that's generally considered by most people when they're interpreting how to view someone who has a phd
[2:29 PM] HaxJester: it says that you've completed those things to institution standards
[2:29 PM] fancy: i.e. what course they took, where, what the course entailed, etc
[2:29 PM] HaxJester: anyone who knows what a PhD means would interpret it that way, yes
[2:30 PM] HaxJester: ofc, they wouldn't know it as detailed as to the courses that they took
[2:30 PM] fancy: yeah so what they're really going off of is a generalize meaning of what a phd is
[2:30 PM] HaxJester: but if you say you have a PhD in electrical engineering
[2:30 PM] HaxJester: someone who would look at it would interpret it that you have a recognized understanding within that field
[2:31 PM] HaxJester: and also
[2:31 PM] fancy: yeah, so pretty generalized compared to what you actually specifically did
[2:31 PM] HaxJester: they would interpret it as you have it to the standard established on a certain date by a certain institute
[2:31 PM] fancy: I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't even go that detailed
[2:32 PM] HaxJester: so I've just established that it's something that you can #1 - physically obtain, #2 - people would recognize that it's something that is physically obtainable
[2:32 PM] fancy: oof
[2:32 PM] fancy: still hard disagree with #1
[2:32 PM] fancy: the paper is meaningless
[2:32 PM] fancy: it's what the paper represents
[2:32 PM] fancy: that's my entire point
[2:32 PM] HaxJester: is what it represents not the meaning behind it?
[2:33 PM] fancy: they're related but separate
[2:33 PM] HaxJester: is the representation not the meaning
[2:33 PM] HaxJester: jfc is this the GodHi thing again
[2:33 PM] fancy: no
[2:33 PM] fancy: here look
[2:33 PM] fancy: because you're saying "you can't physically attain 'respect'"
[2:34 PM] HaxJester: ok, here, I'll use another criteria for it
[2:34 PM] fancy: when you very much can, there's just not a societal convention around accrediting certain groups to hand out paper that says you have
[2:34 PM] HaxJester: 2 people with the same individual interest, say "be respected" can undertake different actions to attain the same result
[2:35 PM] fancy: ok, so?
[2:35 PM] fancy: you can also attain phd's from different universities that probably don't all have the same requirements
[2:35 PM] HaxJester: 2 people with the same personal interest, say "get a specific PhD", will need to do relatively the same thing - take the same courses, attend the same institution
[2:35 PM] fancy: so that's more akin to saying
[2:35 PM] fancy: "i want to be respected by x person"
[2:35 PM] fancy: in which case you'd have to do probably very similar things
[2:35 PM] fancy: as someone else that also wants that person to respect them
[2:38 PM] HaxJester: yeah, no, I was gonna extend it to that actually
[2:38 PM] HaxJester: you can actually do very different things even then
[2:38 PM] fancy: so because there's multiple paths to a goal, somehow it's classified as fundamentally different?
[2:38 PM] HaxJester: like say you have a prof from that PhD school who teaches electrical engineering and plays basketball
[2:39 PM] HaxJester: you can be respected by him by winning a engineering competition or a basketball competition
[2:39 PM] HaxJester: this is like
[2:39 PM] HaxJester: one of the few ways that personal interest (per your source), and individual interests (per what I'm looking at) are different
[2:40 PM] fancy: if you're gonna go "per my source" then my source also said personal interests can be in general topics
[2:40 PM] HaxJester: also have you had the chance to check what your source is from btw?
[2:40 PM] HaxJester: not where btw, what
[2:40 PM] fancy: but regardless of my source, anything you've explained hasn't demonstrated a meaningful difference between personal and individual
[2:40 PM] fancy: as in
[2:41 PM] HaxJester: I mean
[2:41 PM] HaxJester: it's pretty important here
[2:41 PM] HaxJester: have you checked it?
[2:41 PM] fancy: your examples of each don't come across as distinct to me
[2:41 PM] HaxJester: not saying it's not valid
[2:41 PM] HaxJester: but your source says something very specific because of the related institution
[2:41 PM] fancy: uh
[2:42 PM] fancy: what is says is basically what this says as well:
[2:42 PM] fancy:
Individual interest is a relatively stable evaluative orientation towards certain domains; situational interest is an emotional state aroused by specific features of an activity or a task.
[2:42 PM] HaxJester: aite so
[2:42 PM] HaxJester: here
[2:42 PM] HaxJester: what you're looking at is this

[2:42 PM] HaxJester: your source is on education psychology for the purpose of enhancing the classroom management (related chapter)
[2:44 PM] HaxJester: so what it looks at is how you can enhance the situational interest or build new personal interest, thus the idea on how you're able to establish a connection for building new personal interest
[2:44 PM] HaxJester: which you'd defer to looking at something general
[2:45 PM] HaxJester: and I can imagine that the person who wrote this based his excerpt on the theory of situational vs individual interest
[2:45 PM] HaxJester: but to make it readable and applicable to the average classroom manager (teacher), he used a more applicable idea here
[2:46 PM] fancy: but that notwithstanding, even your own example
[2:46 PM] fancy: doesn't come across to me as distinct
[2:46 PM] HaxJester: because #1 - you can't expect a teacher to have the insight to see what each of their student is interested in on an individual level
and #2 - you can't expect a teacher to have the time to do so
[2:46 PM] HaxJester: category and subcategory
[2:47 PM] HaxJester: it doesn't seem distinct because the author derived the idea of personal interest from individual interest
[2:47 PM] fancy:
even your own example
[2:47 PM] HaxJester: but based on the material, it's a subcategory at most
[2:47 PM] HaxJester: I mean, I just established like 3 ways on how they're different
[2:48 PM] HaxJester: to me, it's not worth trying to convince you that a PhD is a specific goal rather than a general goal
[2:49 PM] fancy: it's more that I don't think "be respected" is any less physically attainable than "get a phd"
[2:49 PM] HaxJester: what questions would you ask me if I told you to "get a phd"
[2:50 PM] fancy: "which phd, what field, do you care what institution, why do you want me to have a phd, what time frame do you want this in"
[2:50 PM] fancy: etc
[2:50 PM] HaxJester: ok now ask yourself this
[2:50 PM] HaxJester: would you ask the last 2 as well?
[2:50 PM] fancy: yes?
[2:50 PM] HaxJester: do you want to ask yourself
[2:51 PM] fancy: actually my first question would be why
[2:51 PM] HaxJester: "why do I want myself to have a PhD?"
[2:51 PM] fancy: yes
[2:51 PM] fancy: I ask myself these things all the time
[2:51 PM] fancy: that's why I don't go get a phd
[2:51 PM] fancy: because the answer is
[2:51 PM] fancy: "oh yeah I really don't"
[2:51 PM] HaxJester: aite so the first 3 that you have, though, are constraints
[2:52 PM] fancy: yeah I'm trying to determine the details of the request
[2:52 PM] HaxJester: you're establishing that you can only get PhDs from specific fiends and institutions
[2:52 PM] fancy: because "get a phd" is a broad and useless goal
[2:52 PM] HaxJester: a bank is not going to hand out PhDs
[2:52 PM] HaxJester: what constrains would "get respect" have
[2:53 PM] fancy: "by whom, for what reason, in what time frame, why would I want that in the first place"
[2:53 PM] fancy: very similar questions
[2:54 PM] fancy: because, again "get respect", much like "get a phd" is a non-actionable goal
[2:54 PM] HaxJester: ok so the why and in what time frame doesn't really act as constraints, so you can disregard that
[2:54 PM] fancy: what
[2:54 PM] fancy: of course it does
[2:54 PM] fancy: it applies just as much as the phd question
[2:54 PM] HaxJester: I mean, I disregarded the why and what time frame as well in there
[2:54 PM] fancy: unless we throw those out as well
[2:54 PM] HaxJester: cus they're not limiting your pool
[2:54 PM] fancy: ok sure
[2:54 PM] HaxJester: but anyways
[2:54 PM] HaxJester: what's left is
[2:55 PM] HaxJester: "by whom, for what reason"
[2:55 PM] fancy: well
[2:55 PM] fancy: actually yea
[2:55 PM] fancy: I remember what I meant now
[2:55 PM] HaxJester: are you unable to get respect from anyone?
[2:55 PM] fancy: lol
[2:55 PM] HaxJester: I mean time is a factor
[2:55 PM] fancy: uh yeah fundamentally
[2:55 PM] HaxJester: but wouldn't anyone give you respect
[2:55 PM] fancy: meaningful respect?
[2:55 PM] fancy: yes
[2:55 PM] fancy: well
[2:55 PM] fancy: yes as in
[2:55 PM] HaxJester: over time, yes
[2:55 PM] HaxJester: so that's not a constraint
[2:55 PM] fancy: wait
[2:56 PM] fancy: let me actually fully say what I'm trying to say
[2:56 PM] HaxJester: if you gotten respect for one reason, would you suddenly be unable to get respect for a different reason?
[2:56 PM] fancy: "anyone can give you respect, but not everyone can give you meaningful respect"
[2:56 PM] fancy: just like
[2:56 PM] fancy: anyoen can hand you a "phd"
[2:56 PM] fancy: but unless it's from someone specific, it's meaningless
[2:57 PM] HaxJester: aite, it seems that we're still going around in circles about how there are these people who supposedly peddle PhDs
[2:57 PM] fancy: do you disagree with that fundamental idea
[2:57 PM] fancy: that some people produce meaningless respect
[2:58 PM] fancy: because generally, if you're respected by someone that I don't respect, that doesn't often lead me to respect you by that merit
[2:58 PM] fancy: whereas, if someone I respect in turn respects you
[2:58 PM] fancy: I'm much more likely to respect your respect
[2:58 PM] HaxJester: I think I answered something similar, as to how nice is usually tolerant nowadays, so same idea, it's a distinction between tolerant and respecting
[2:59 PM] fancy: but I'm not talking about being polite or tolerant
[2:59 PM] HaxJester: ok, how would you know that someone respects you?
[3:00 PM] fancy: generally how they regard you, actions, words, etc
[3:00 PM] HaxJester: would that be all?
[3:00 PM] fancy: "all"
[3:00 PM] fancy: as if that's not the sum total of things a person can do
[3:01 PM] fancy: lol
[3:01 PM] fancy: if you're asking how quantifiable it is, then the answer is "not very"
[3:01 PM] fancy: but that doesn't make it less real
[3:02 PM] HaxJester: well I'd specify that and in comparison to the same behavior to others, cus two different people can act that way but with completely different level of respect
[3:02 PM] fancy: well, yeah
[3:02 PM] HaxJester: though I guess my specific classification of respecting is that
[3:02 PM] fancy: that was implied
[3:02 PM] fancy: but yes
[3:03 PM] fancy: it's a comparison of how they regard you and how they regard people in general
[3:03 PM] HaxJester: I can make someone get nothing and still come around and say that they would deal with me again
[3:03 PM] HaxJester: how would you know that someone has a PhD though?
[3:03 PM] fancy: someone vouches for them saying they've done X
[3:04 PM] fancy: the someone in this case
[3:04 PM] fancy: being the university in question
[3:04 PM] HaxJester: oh, not just seeing the paper?
[3:04 PM] fancy: the paper is the voucher lol
[3:04 PM] HaxJester: so there's that distinction again
[3:04 PM] HaxJester: general vs specific
[3:04 PM] fancy: well no?
[3:04 PM] fancy: i don't see this as being different
[3:04 PM] HaxJester: different ways to see that you accomplished an individual interest vs personal interest
[3:04 PM] fancy: that was two different contexts
[3:05 PM] HaxJester: well, it seems like you don't separate the general vs specific well tbh
[3:05 PM] fancy: "how do I know someone respects me" vs "how do I know someone else has a phd"
[3:05 PM] HaxJester: ?
[3:05 PM] HaxJester: I literally asked
[3:05 PM] HaxJester: "how would you know that someone respects you?" and "how would you know that someone has a PhD though?"
[3:05 PM] fancy: so
[3:06 PM] HaxJester: and you gave me a general for one, specific for another
[3:06 PM] HaxJester: are you against the idea that the is a distinction between general and specific?
[3:06 PM] HaxJester: the cases for all, and cases for one?
[3:06 PM] fancy: wait do you not see
[3:06 PM] fancy: that the former and the latter are from two different perspectives?
[3:06 PM] HaxJester: nah, I want to know this now actually
[3:06 PM] HaxJester: are you against the idea that the is a distinction between general and specific?
[3:07 PM] fancy: depends on the context but I'm never "against" an idea intrinsically
[3:07 PM] HaxJester: cus my question was literally "how would you know that someone" then "does x"
[3:07 PM] HaxJester: in whatever context you see
[3:07 PM] fancy: so
[3:07 PM] HaxJester: are you against the idea that the is a distinction between general and specific?
[3:08 PM] fancy: that answer is vacuous with no context you know
[3:08 PM] fancy: it's like asking "are you against murder"
[3:08 PM] HaxJester: would you answer be different based on the context?
[3:08 PM] fancy: because the answer isn't "no" and it isn't "yes" in all contexts
[3:08 PM] fancy: yes
[3:08 PM] fancy: case: abortion
[3:08 PM] HaxJester: in what context would it be a no?
[3:09 PM] fancy: I'm not against murdering the child to save the parent
[3:09 PM] fancy: case: death penalty
[3:09 PM] HaxJester: so how is there a distinction between general and specific in the case of abortion?
[3:09 PM] fancy: case: self defense
[3:09 PM] fancy: because generally "murder is bad"
[3:09 PM] fancy: specific cases: "it's bad but sometimes not the worst option"
[3:10 PM] fancy: but now I'm curious
[3:10 PM] fancy: do you not see the perspective difference between
[3:10 PM] fancy: "how do I know you think x about me" vs "how do I know you have done x according to person y"
[3:10 PM] HaxJester: would you say that there is the general concept of murder interconnecting all of these then?
[3:11 PM] fancy: I don't know what that question means
[3:11 PM] HaxJester: aite, so one at a time
[3:11 PM] fancy: yes murder is involved in all discussions of murder...?

[3:12 PM] HaxJester: actually I wouldn't even say that, cus people are still arguing at which point is abortion murder, but sure, let's say murder is the general concept in all of those
[3:12 PM] HaxJester: and you can go into specific for each of those.
[3:12 PM] HaxJester: on the question you asked me
[3:12 PM] HaxJester: would the question you just asked me not establish the distinction I asked you in the first place?
[3:13 PM] fancy: which question
[3:13 PM] HaxJester: how people would think about you for individual
vs 
what people can see you accomplished for personal?
[3:13 PM] HaxJester: like, if you can see the difference in perspective there
[3:13 PM] fancy: no, I don't see a meaningful difference in classifying those as different kinds of interest
[3:13 PM] HaxJester: why would you be against the difference here
[3:14 PM] fancy: wait so let me clarify
[3:14 PM] HaxJester: ok which is exactly why I said
[3:14 PM] HaxJester: it's important to see the source
[3:14 PM] HaxJester: cus your guy took the general concept and narrowed it down to a specific case application
[3:14 PM] HaxJester: you clearly see the difference between them yourself
[3:14 PM] fancy: I don't disagree that there are definitely goals that are easier to see as accomplished than others
[3:14 PM] fancy: but
[3:15 PM] fancy: I wouldn't say the "types" of interest in achieving prominent vs obscure goals is fundamentally different
[3:15 PM] fancy: that seems asinine to me
[3:15 PM] fancy: and I don't know what we gain from that distinction
[3:15 PM] HaxJester: aite I'm giving you the statement that this distinction is going to be important here then
[3:15 PM] HaxJester: so separate the personal and the individual
[3:16 PM] fancy: you can assert that sure
[3:16 PM] fancy: but you'd have to demonstrate it
[3:16 PM] fancy: so go ahead
[3:16 PM] HaxJester: so what happens is that even these personal goals that we've been looking at are ways to address underlying individual goals
[3:17 PM] HaxJester: the idea of getting a PhD could be in order to achieve respect
[3:17 PM] fancy: yes, that's something I've said before, every action* has a top level motivation
[3:17 PM] HaxJester: individual goals are effectively the highest level motivation
[3:18 PM] HaxJester: so I think this addresses your thought on "how people don't know their motivation" pretty well
[3:18 PM] HaxJester: in that
[3:18 PM] HaxJester: it's not necessarily that people don't know their motivation for the action that they're doing
[3:19 PM] HaxJester: people don't know their motivation at these specific levels
[3:19 PM] fancy: uh
[3:19 PM] fancy: that's what I mean though
[3:20 PM] HaxJester: so coincidentally this is where all the conversation hacks take place
[3:20 PM] fancy: obviously everyone has some understanding of why they're doing things, they're not completely blind
[3:20 PM] fancy: but the number of people that actually think it through
[3:20 PM] fancy: to its logical end
[3:20 PM] fancy: is like
[3:20 PM] fancy: miniscule
[3:20 PM] fancy: and yeah if I wanted to hack my way and hold their hand all the way there
[3:20 PM] fancy: I could
[3:20 PM] fancy: but that's boring to me
[3:20 PM] fancy: thus the problem
[3:20 PM] HaxJester: nah
[3:21 PM] HaxJester: you're doing all of those in like an hour talk
[3:21 PM] fancy: wait
[3:21 PM] fancy: did you just
[3:21 PM] fancy: counter "that's boring" with
[3:21 PM] fancy: "nah it takes an hour"
[3:21 PM] fancy: :kannaLook:
[3:21 PM] HaxJester: yes
[3:21 PM] fancy: so
[3:21 PM] fancy: do you see
[3:21 PM] fancy: how that makes no sense
[3:21 PM] HaxJester: if you would spend years with a person
[3:21 PM] fancy: I don't think it's boring because of the time it takes, I think it's boring because the activity itself is boring
[3:22 PM] HaxJester: why would an investment that is less than 0.1% of the total time be significant?
[3:22 PM] fancy: you're changing goalposts
[3:22 PM] fancy: it's not significant vs insignificant
[3:22 PM] fancy: it's boring
[3:22 PM] HaxJester: and also boring is related to attention, and attention is time based
[3:22 PM] fancy: it's also interest based
[3:23 PM] fancy: and when interest is 0
[3:23 PM] fancy: interest maintained across time is also 0
[3:23 PM] HaxJester: well, attention is related to interest
[3:23 PM] fancy: the interest is 0
[3:23 PM] fancy: thus
[3:23 PM] fancy: activity is boring
[3:23 PM] fancy: think the time limit is about
[3:23 PM] fancy: probably 50-70 seconds
[3:23 PM] fancy: before I'd get bored
[3:23 PM] HaxJester: well, I except I wouldn't say the interest is 0
[3:23 PM] fancy: rough estimate
[3:24 PM] fancy: my interest in people who haven't thought this through is indeed 0
[3:24 PM] HaxJester: because if you're able to ask yourself these questions
[3:24 PM] fancy: at least romantically speaking
[3:24 PM] HaxJester: then you have interest in knowing
[3:24 PM] fancy: you changed context again
[3:24 PM] fancy: my interest in figuring myself out is very high
[3:24 PM] fancy: my interest in figuring other people out
[3:24 PM] fancy: is very low
[3:25 PM] HaxJester: didn't you try to figure other people out yourself though?
[3:25 PM] fancy: yes, you have to
[3:25 PM] fancy: doesn't mean I think it's interesting
[3:25 PM] HaxJester: no you don't
[3:25 PM] HaxJester: if your interest is actually 0
[3:25 PM] HaxJester: then you'd do nothing
[3:25 PM] fancy: my interest in specifically figuring htem out
[3:26 PM] fancy: is 0
[3:26 PM] fancy: my interest in other things
[3:26 PM] fancy: is not 0
[3:26 PM] fancy: such as my interest in getting certain things from certain people
[3:26 PM] fancy: here, an example:
[3:26 PM] fancy: I hate having lunch with my boss
[3:26 PM] fancy: I hate having lunch with people in general
[3:27 PM] fancy: I hate eating with people in general
[3:27 PM] fancy: it doesn't make sense to me, I find it annoying
[3:27 PM] fancy: if I had a choice in a vacuum, I'd never do it
[3:27 PM] fancy: HOWEVER
[3:27 PM] fancy: this takes backseat to my interest in my boss liking me
[3:27 PM] fancy: but I'm not trying to be romantically involved with my boss
[3:27 PM] fancy: I just want things from him
[3:27 PM] fancy: namely: money, promotions, and referrals
[3:28 PM] fancy: so I trade
[3:28 PM] fancy: however
[3:28 PM] fancy: in the context of romantic relationships
[3:28 PM] fancy: as I said before
[3:28 PM] fancy: that game is not something I want to play
[3:28 PM] fancy: because I find the game exhausting, and not entirely interesting
[3:28 PM] HaxJester: I mean, in that lunch example you gave
[3:29 PM] HaxJester: you just established that your interest in having lunch with other people in your company is clearly not 0
[3:29 PM] fancy: its inherent interest is 0
[3:29 PM] fancy: it gets interest by proxy
[3:29 PM] fancy: because it's a means to an end
[3:29 PM] fancy: but I don't want my entire life to be doing things that are means to ends
[3:29 PM] HaxJester: interest by proxy will still apply to what you would do
[3:29 PM] HaxJester: kinda going back to that personal, situational, individual thing
[3:30 PM] HaxJester: personal and individual interest both proxy for the situation
[3:30 PM] HaxJester: your end interest is 0 for something when all these level are at 0
[3:31 PM] fancy: sure
[3:31 PM] fancy: I'll grant you that 0 is an exaggeration to make a point
[3:32 PM] fancy: the original point was
[3:32 PM] fancy: I find it boring
[3:32 PM] fancy: and thus if there's no external gain from it
[3:33 PM] fancy: there's no poitn to me doing it
[3:33 PM] fancy: but in the context of romantic relationships
[3:33 PM] fancy: there is no external gain
[3:33 PM] fancy: the person is the end, not the means
[3:34 PM] fancy: phrasing
[3:34 PM] HaxJester: well for your case of romantic relationship, if it ever reoccur for whatever reason
[3:35 PM] HaxJester: would you be against the idea of using 1 hour to figure our the person rather than using 1 month-1 year?
[3:35 PM] fancy: again, not intrinsically

[3:35 PM] fancy: it depends on the cost
[3:36 PM] HaxJester: I gave you the costs
[3:36 PM] fancy: what
[3:36 PM] fancy: you can't "give me the costs"
[3:36 PM] HaxJester: 1 hour
[3:36 PM] HaxJester: that's your cost
[3:36 PM] HaxJester: is it not?
[3:36 PM] fancy: that's not the only cost
[3:36 PM] fancy: LOL
[3:36 PM] HaxJester: that is the universal cost that applies to all
[3:36 PM] fancy: it is one of the costs
[3:37 PM] fancy: effort is a cost
[3:37 PM] HaxJester: you can take or give whatever additional costs you want
[3:37 PM] HaxJester: effort of 1 hour to effort of 1 month
[3:37 PM] fancy: X effort across 1 hour vs Y effort across 1 month
[3:37 PM] fancy: to be exact
[3:37 PM] fancy: because X and Y are def not the same
[3:38 PM] fancy: though if I think about it
[3:38 PM] fancy: probably the best option
[3:38 PM] fancy: is to straight up ask them direct questions in the first 15 minutes
[3:38 PM] fancy: and then peace if they can't answer them
[3:38 PM] fancy: tho that's a pretty scorched earth solution
[3:39 PM] HaxJester: kinda like that idea but less the direct questions
[3:39 PM] HaxJester: more like leading questions
[3:39 PM] fancy: yeah so that gets a little sketch
[3:39 PM] fancy: imo
[3:39 PM] HaxJester: cus direct questions raises people's guard about stuff
[3:39 PM] HaxJester: aite
[3:39 PM] fancy: cus now it's become more manipulation
[3:39 PM] HaxJester: emotionally tactical questions
[3:39 PM] fancy: than just asking
[3:39 PM] HaxJester: ok so that's the beautiful part
[3:39 PM] fancy: and that's gonna violate some of my other pillars
[3:40 PM] HaxJester: cus when people feel like that you understand them at this individual level
[3:40 PM] HaxJester: they're willing to work things out with you to fulfill those interests
[3:41 PM] HaxJester: and conversely, you'll be willing to work things out with them too
[3:41 PM] fancy: again, all depends on what exactly we're working out
[3:41 PM] HaxJester: because you'll naturally feel inclined to do so when you understand people
[3:42 PM] HaxJester: for the concept or for your application
[3:42 PM] fancy: but generally, if you're not open enough such that I have to lead you in to being open and/or thinking about these things in teh first place
[3:42 PM] HaxJester: cus the concept applies to everyone
[3:42 PM] fancy: then :thumbsdown:
[3:42 PM] fancy: I don't want to shoulder that work
[3:42 PM] fancy: cus to me that's not an interesting problem to solve anymore
[3:43 PM] fancy: if I have to catch you up to where I am
[3:43 PM] HaxJester: well that's up to your interests in the end
[3:43 PM] fancy: I already solved that part
[3:43 PM] fancy: problems are only interesting the first iteration of a solution
[3:43 PM] HaxJester: but nobody will be open to you to let you know everything
[3:43 PM] HaxJester: you'd have to address their underlying concerns to get to that
[3:43 PM] fancy: I would
[3:44 PM] fancy: thus: I expect them to for me to be interested
[3:44 PM] HaxJester: aite so example
[3:46 PM] HaxJester: if I were to ask you "can I ask you about something"
does it occur to you to ask the question "about what?"
[3:47 PM] fancy: no
[3:47 PM] fancy: well
[3:47 PM] fancy: only in the context of time right
[3:48 PM] fancy: so like if you wanna ask a question I need 3 hours to respond to
[3:48 PM] fancy: and I have 10 minutes before I leave
[3:48 PM] fancy: it's minorly relevant
[3:48 PM] fancy: but that's a practical consideration, not related to whether I want to answer the question or not
[3:48 PM] HaxJester: and yes, even the time is an underlying concern
[3:49 PM] HaxJester: since the example applies, I'll just use yours
[3:49 PM] HaxJester: there's the question of
[3:49 PM] HaxJester: "do I want to talk about this something for as long as you do?"
[3:50 PM] HaxJester: as per your example
[3:50 PM] fancy: the answer to that in my case is almost universally  "yes"
[3:50 PM] HaxJester: whether you like it or not, people are always on guard for talking, just to varying degrees
[3:51 PM] fancy: yes I am aware
[3:51 PM] HaxJester: so nobody will ever be open to tell you everything unless you can alleviate these concerns
[3:52 PM] fancy: Also aware of that
[3:52 PM] fancy: thus the problem I have
[3:53 PM] fancy: Which is I think it's a negative character trait to be closed off to talking about a certain topic
[3:53 PM] fancy: and, specifically for romantic stuffs, it's a deal-breaker
[3:53 PM] HaxJester: well that's gonna be a tough one then
[3:53 PM] fancy: but I am aware this is how most people are
[3:54 PM] HaxJester: cus people are naturally gonna lean away from that
[3:54 PM] fancy: "dating is bad for me"
[3:54 PM] fancy: which is why I say
[3:54 PM] fancy: whoops
[3:54 PM] fancy: discord died
[3:54 PM] fancy: but yeah def

[3:54 PM] HaxJester: well I'd probably make it specifically
[3:54 PM] HaxJester: dating is bad for you in your current mentality
[3:54 PM] fancy: I wouldn't say it that way
[3:54 PM] fancy: specifically, I'd say that
[3:55 PM] fancy: my philosophy and the philosophy of most people aren't compatible
[3:55 PM] HaxJester: dating is bad for you with your current philosophy
[3:55 PM] fancy: because I don't think either one is objectively wrong
[3:56 PM] fancy: I would hesitate to phrase it that way because there is the potential implication that my philosophy/mentality is wrong or insufficient
[3:56 PM] fancy: which I don't think is true
[3:56 PM] HaxJester: I mean
[3:56 PM] HaxJester: you're expecting people to do something that they won't naturally do
[3:57 PM] HaxJester: I'd even go as far to say that this is something they cannot naturally do
[3:57 PM] HaxJester: and as much as you'd like
[3:57 PM] fancy: so?
[3:57 PM] fancy: there's lots of stuff we don't do naturally but is expected by society
[3:57 PM] HaxJester: nah
[3:57 PM] fancy: yikes
[3:57 PM] HaxJester: not an expectation of society at this point
[3:57 PM] fancy: wait
[3:57 PM] fancy: ok you're moving goalposts again
[3:58 PM] fancy: if your point was actually "this isn't something that most of society expects of people"
[3:58 PM] fancy: that is true
[3:58 PM] HaxJester: the idea that people naturally won't talk about stuff unless you dismiss their concerns is a rule of psychology
[3:58 PM] fancy: but whether it's natural or not is irrelevant
[3:58 PM] HaxJester: not an expectation of society
[3:58 PM] HaxJester: as much as you'd like, people just won't do it
[3:58 PM] HaxJester: it's like laws of gravity
[3:59 PM] fancy: do you think psychology is a constant?
[3:59 PM] HaxJester: as much as you'd like to fly, you're gonna hit the floor when you jump off the building
[3:59 PM] HaxJester: psychology has it's constraints
[3:59 PM] HaxJester: you can do things under a setting and people will react towards "the same direction"
[3:59 PM] HaxJester: the magnitude is different because of chemistry
[3:59 PM] fancy: given certain circumstances yes
[4:00 PM] fancy: that's the entire basis of science, I would agree
[4:00 PM] HaxJester: and the exception for these occur only during wiring, not chemistry
[4:00 PM] fancy: so why am I different
[4:00 PM] HaxJester: you aren't
[4:00 PM] fancy: so if I can do it
[4:00 PM] fancy: why can't other people
[4:00 PM] HaxJester: you've established yourself that "you will not talk unless your concerns are addressed" - rule of psychology
[4:00 PM] HaxJester: but your chemistry is different
[4:00 PM] HaxJester: which means that
[4:00 PM] HaxJester: you have less concerns
[4:01 PM] fancy: so do you think I was just born that way
[4:01 PM] fancy: or do you think I've chosen to be this way
[4:01 PM] HaxJester: could be all sorts of factors
[4:01 PM] fancy: i.e. less concerns
[4:01 PM] HaxJester: but people with chemistry differences can be persuaded otherwise
[4:01 PM] fancy: so doesn't that directly contradict whether people are naturally going to be like me or not
[4:02 PM] HaxJester: people can have the chemistry that they have almost no concern when it comes to talking about sexual stuff
[4:02 PM] HaxJester: you see them all the time
[4:02 PM] HaxJester: the sluts/camgirls
[4:03 PM] fancy: that's a bit of a shakey example but yes, there are definitely other people that have fewer concerns than most people
[4:03 PM] fancy: so that comes back to what you said
[4:03 PM] fancy: which was
[4:04 PM] fancy:
you're expecting people to do something that they won't naturally do
I'd even go as far to say that this is something they cannot naturally do
[4:04 PM] fancy: to which my response was "whether it's natural or not is irrelevant"
[4:04 PM] fancy: because either they develop the lack of concern such that is compatible with mine
[4:04 PM] fancy: or they don't
[4:04 PM] fancy: neither one is right nor wrong
[4:05 PM] fancy: my position is just by far less common
[4:05 PM] fancy: but I've chosen it because of a value judgment that I've made
[4:05 PM] fancy: most people don't choose it
[4:05 PM] fancy: thus: incompatibility
[4:06 PM] fancy: there's not a general expectation of society for the individual to have fewer concerns
[4:06 PM] fancy: which is why most people aren't conditioned to do that
[4:07 PM] HaxJester: hmm, i'd actually have to take back what I said there, it is possible for someone to have the chemistry that allows it
[4:07 PM] fancy: what do you mean

[4:08 PM] HaxJester: well, I guess it's now just a matter of fulfilling the other criteria
[4:08 PM] fancy: wait
[4:08 PM] fancy: what are you taking back
[4:08 PM] fancy: the part I quoted?
[4:08 PM] HaxJester: yeah
[4:08 PM] fancy: uh
[4:08 PM] fancy: hmm
[4:09 PM] fancy: you mean it's possible for someone to be born such that
[4:09 PM] fancy: they just naturally don't care
[4:09 PM] fancy: or what
[4:09 PM] HaxJester: it's possible for someone to have fewer concerns when you ask them something
[4:10 PM] fancy: well we already knew that
[4:10 PM] HaxJester: because the number of concerns that they'd have is determinable through brain chemistry
[4:10 PM] fancy: huh
[4:10 PM] fancy: what does that mean
[4:10 PM] fancy: isn't that all mutable though
[4:10 PM] fancy: like I definitely used to care about a lot more things than I do now
[4:11 PM] fancy: and about different things as well
[4:11 PM] fancy: so not sure I follow
[4:11 PM] HaxJester: hmm, brain chemistry specifically refers to the magnitude of a reaction basically
[4:12 PM] HaxJester: not sure if that's mutable tbh
[4:12 PM] HaxJester: this refers more to how you can have varying degrees of actions to get the same results
[4:12 PM] HaxJester: mutable would refer to how varying degrees of actions would get the same result on the same person with a change
[4:13 PM] HaxJester: but now I'm not sure if that would be related to the actual chemistry component
[4:13 PM] fancy: mutable in this case would refer to the emotional response of a person to a certain situation, no
[4:13 PM] fancy: is that not the basis of a concern
[4:13 PM] HaxJester: or if it would be classified under just
[4:13 PM] HaxJester: alternate interest
[4:14 PM] fancy: regardless, I don't think it changes the end result
[4:14 PM] fancy: which is currently, people aren't very open by default, and few people make efforts to change that
[4:14 PM] fancy: whether the default is a product of natural factors or societal ones
[4:14 PM] fancy: doesn't really matter too much
[4:15 PM] fancy: because the fact that I can exist and hold the position that I do, means that it is possible
[4:15 PM] HaxJester: well, that one I can probably offer to you that it's both
[4:15 PM] fancy: but just most people aren't like that
[4:15 PM] fancy: yeah it's probably both
[4:15 PM] HaxJester: naturally people will be on guard for talking
[4:15 PM] fancy: but it's really hard to tell
[4:15 PM] fancy: because you can't really measure a completely natural person
[4:15 PM] HaxJester: society determines which subject people will be on guard about
[4:15 PM] fancy: ethically, that is
[4:15 PM] fancy: :poppo:
[4:16 PM] HaxJester: and both are addressable in the same way
[4:17 PM] fancy: just have fewer concerns
[4:17 PM] fancy: easy
[4:17 PM] fancy: :poppo:
[4:18 PM] fancy: but yeah I mean
[4:18 PM] fancy: it's basically an unsolvable problem right
[4:23 PM] fancy: cus the solution on both sides, mine and other people's is basically just
[4:23 PM] fancy: "change what you value"
[5:03 PM] HaxJester: yeah that's impractical though, expecting other to change values on their own
[5:03 PM] HaxJester: always more reliable to change it for them yourself
[5:04 PM] fancy: right but that's not a good solution imo
[5:41 PM] fancy: aite so I'm reading some more
[5:42 PM] fancy: and I'm actually not sure I agree that there's a disctintion between situational interests either
[5:42 PM] fancy: it feels like they all reduce down to each other
[5:43 PM] fancy: so unless I'm missing something in all this stuffs
[5:43 PM] fancy: :KRThinking:
[5:44 PM] HaxJester: situation vs personal per your source looks at what you're doing in the moment vs what you would want to be doing
[5:45 PM] fancy: that's not how I interpreted it at all
[5:45 PM] HaxJester: which I imagine is to cater to the common classroom occurrence of being in the class but wanting to go play sports
[5:45 PM] HaxJester: or any other activity
[5:45 PM] fancy: I'm not sure where you're getting that from
[5:46 PM] HaxJester: "Situational interests are ones that are triggered temporarily by features of the immediate situation"
[5:47 PM] HaxJester: being in the classroom is the feature of the immediate situation, it triggers the situation(al interest) of whatever pertains to the classroom
[5:47 PM] fancy: it can, yes
[5:47 PM] HaxJester: "Outside class, though, he or she usually has additional personal interests in particular non-academic activities"
the sports that they'd want to go play after class
[5:47 PM] HaxJester: which I'd imagine the author is trying to say
[5:48 PM] fancy: those two sentences aren't being contrasted
[5:48 PM] HaxJester: your students aren't personally interested in going back into the classroom once that's done
[5:48 PM] fancy: that isn't what he said
[5:48 PM] HaxJester: that isn't what he said, yes, but in this situation
[5:48 PM] HaxJester: with what he's addressing
[5:48 PM] HaxJester: it's likely what's leading to his classification
[5:49 PM] HaxJester: but going back the how they aren't contrasted
[5:49 PM] HaxJester: cus they aren't necessarily contrasts
[5:49 PM] fancy: that would be a poor structuring of the paragraph then
[5:49 PM] HaxJester: there's nothing against agreements between the two
[5:49 PM] HaxJester: it's just what it is classified as
[5:49 PM] HaxJester: it's like
[5:49 PM] HaxJester: different sources of interest
[5:50 PM] HaxJester: author is probably trying to explain that it's important to understand the sources to control the situation
[5:52 PM] fancy: sure maybe
[5:52 PM] fancy: but regardless
[5:52 PM] fancy: my point was
[5:53 PM] fancy: it feels like all these types reduce down to the same thing in the end
[5:53 PM] fancy: and they're not really that different at all
[5:53 PM] fancy: so I'm failing to see the value in distinguishing them from each other
[5:55 PM] fancy: because any situational interest seems, intuitively, that it will tie back to some persistent generalize interest
[5:56 PM] fancy: and likewise, any generalized or individual interest could at some point die out, at which point there's been a finite cap on it based on a series of situations
[5:57 PM] fancy: which is more or less an extension of the descriptions of situational interests that I'm reading
[5:57 PM] fancy: so what it really seems to be about is a variation on the emotions vs reason theme
[5:57 PM] fancy: at least to me
[6:04 PM] HaxJester: so in what sense would they not be different?
[6:04 PM] fancy: so the examples of situational interest that I'm reading
[6:04 PM] fancy: all seem to key off the fact that
[6:04 PM] fancy: a person is doing something and they're not really engaged
[6:05 PM] fancy: until something about it strikes them
[6:05 PM] HaxJester: aite so what you said
[6:05 PM] fancy: that for whatever reason they find interesting
[6:05 PM] HaxJester: but stop at the and
[6:05 PM] HaxJester: "a person is doing something" on its own
[6:05 PM] HaxJester: is as far as situational interest goes
[6:05 PM] HaxJester: everything after the and pertains to personal interest
[6:06 PM] fancy: there's no interest in "a person is doing something"
[6:06 PM] fancy: that's just a statement
[6:06 PM] HaxJester: in a sense, sure
[6:06 PM] HaxJester: but since situational interest is limited to the interest to the task that arises from the immediate environment
[6:07 PM] HaxJester: the fact that the person is doing the thing is all that drives situational interest
[6:07 PM] HaxJester: and also
[6:07 PM] fancy: that doesn't really match at all with anything I've read
[6:07 PM] fancy: so I'm gonna need a source on that one
[6:07 PM] HaxJester: Situational interest is elicited by aspects of an object or a situation, such as novelty or intensity, or by the presence of interest-inducing factors contributing to the attractiveness of the situation (Krapp, 1999; Tobias, 1994).
[6:07 PM] HaxJester: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/situational-interest
[6:08 PM] HaxJester: so also
[6:08 PM] fancy: that doesn't prove what you said
[6:08 PM] HaxJester: the fact that you're in the situation in the first place means you had personal interest in the first place
[6:08 PM] HaxJester: which you went along with and entered the situation
[6:08 PM] fancy: that actually supports what I said
[6:08 PM] HaxJester: "but since situational interest is limited to the interest to the task that arises from the immediate environment"
[6:08 PM] HaxJester: ???
[6:09 PM] HaxJester: aspects of an object or a situation = the immediate environment
[6:09 PM] fancy: which is "something about it that strikes them"
[6:09 PM] fancy: that's an aspect of the current thing
[6:09 PM] fancy: such as novelty or intensity
[6:09 PM] fancy: which is exactly what I said
[6:10 PM] HaxJester: well, you said that, yes
[6:10 PM] HaxJester: but it is restricted to the immediately available factors
6:11 PM] fancy: yeah so
[6:11 PM] HaxJester: and novelty and intensity are adjectives
[6:11 PM] HaxJester: so you gotta add something afterwards
[6:11 PM] fancy: something about the current activity strikes them
[6:11 PM] fancy: some aspect of it
[6:11 PM] HaxJester: yes
[6:11 PM] fancy: also novelty is a noun
[6:11 PM] fancy: as is intensity
[6:11 PM] fancy: :poppo:
[6:11 PM] HaxJester: in this excerpt it's used as an adjective
[6:11 PM] fancy: uh
[6:11 PM] HaxJester: novelty or intensity... of interest-inducing factors
[6:11 PM] fancy: no that part of speech is definitely a noun
[6:12 PM] fancy: yeah that's a noun
[6:12 PM] fancy: also
[6:12 PM] fancy: of interest inducing factors
[6:12 PM] fancy: isn't even modifying those two words
[6:12 PM] HaxJester: oh, actually, it's an adjective clause
[6:12 PM] fancy: it's modifying presence
[6:12 PM] HaxJester: well, the way it's used seems to be more on
[6:14 PM] HaxJester: Situational interest is elicited by (aspects of an object), such as ... novelty... of interest-inducing factors
[6:14 PM] fancy: no
[6:14 PM] HaxJester: hmm no, it's actually a noun clause
[6:14 PM] fancy: that's 100% wrong
[6:14 PM] HaxJester: wdym it's 100% wrong
[6:14 PM] fancy: the base sentence is:
Situational interest is elicted by aspects
[6:14 PM] HaxJester: that's straight from the excerpt
[6:14 PM] fancy: your parsing of the sentence is wrong
[6:14 PM] HaxJester: do you have to challenge every excerpt?
[6:14 PM] HaxJester: ok look
[6:15 PM] HaxJester: Situational interest is elicited by aspects of an object or a situation, such as novelty or intensity, or by the presence of interest-inducing factors contributing to the attractiveness of the situation (Krapp, 1999; Tobias, 1994).
[6:15 PM] fancy: yes
[6:15 PM] fancy: base sentence:
Situational interest is elicited by aspects or presence.*
[6:15 PM] fancy: what aspects?
[6:15 PM] fancy: aspects (of an object or a situation)
[6:16 PM] fancy: what kind of aspects?
[6:16 PM] fancy: (such as novelty or intensity)
[6:16 PM] HaxJester: Situational interest is elicited by (aspects of an object or a situation~) (or maintains structure state), such as novelty or intensity, (or by the presence of interest-inducing factors contributing to the attractiveness of the situation(or again) (Krapp, 1999; Tobias, 1994).
[6:17 PM] HaxJester:

[6:17 PM] HaxJester: is that not what I said?
[6:18 PM] fancy: no, the way you cut your excerpt doesn't preserve the meaning
[6:18 PM] fancy: because "of interest-inducing factors" doesn't go with anything else in that excerpt
[6:18 PM] fancy: because "of interest inducing factors" modifies presence
[6:18 PM] fancy: not novelty, which is what is implied by how you cut that sentence
[6:19 PM] HaxJester: bro, I was talking about sentence phrasing there
[6:19 PM] HaxJester: but sure, let's move onto the meaning
[6:20 PM] HaxJester: you're limited to what is immediately available (presence) for situational interest
[6:20 PM] fancy: why are you quoting presence here
[6:20 PM] HaxJester: cus that's the overall meaning
[6:20 PM] HaxJester: is it not?
[6:20 PM] fancy: the overall meaning is "presence of interest-inducing factors"
[6:21 PM] fancy: as in
[6:21 PM] HaxJester: yes
[6:21 PM] fancy: "interesting things exist"
[6:21 PM] HaxJester: key is that it has to be there
[6:21 PM] HaxJester: no
[6:21 PM] fancy: wym no?
[6:21 PM] fancy: lol
[6:21 PM] HaxJester: not necessarily interesting things exist
[6:21 PM] HaxJester: things that you perceive interest in
[6:21 PM] HaxJester: things aren't interesting
[6:21 PM] HaxJester: people see interest in things
[6:21 PM] fancy: ok
[6:21 PM] fancy: so
[6:21 PM] fancy: moving on
[6:22 PM] fancy: you're limited to the interest you perceive in the current scenario
[6:22 PM] fancy: we all agree on this, yes
[6:22 PM] HaxJester: yes
[6:22 PM] fancy: ok
[6:22 PM] fancy: that's what I said originally
[6:22 PM] fancy: "you are doing something and something about it strikes you"
[6:22 PM] fancy: aka
[6:23 PM] fancy: you perceive something about it to be interesting
[6:23 PM] HaxJester: no, the original argument was on how you don't see the difference in situational and personal interest
[6:23 PM] fancy: yes
[6:23 PM] fancy: and so
[6:23 PM] fancy: we can extend this
[6:23 PM] fancy: by asking why you find that particular thing interesting
[6:23 PM] fancy: we're still in the present only
[6:23 PM] fancy: still in the one situation
[6:23 PM] fancy: but why does a particular aspect interest you
[6:24 PM] HaxJester: well wouldn't the why aspect have been thought in the past though
[6:24 PM] fancy: that's my point
[6:24 PM] HaxJester: at which point
[6:24 PM] HaxJester: it disqualifies as situational
[6:24 PM] fancy: the only reason it interests you is because it hits some overall interest you have
[6:24 PM] HaxJester: cus you're looking at something not immediately available
[6:24 PM] HaxJester: sure
[6:24 PM] fancy: yeah
[6:24 PM] fancy: so
[6:24 PM] fancy: essentially the same thing
[6:25 PM] fancy: because without that generalized interest
[6:25 PM] fancy: you wouldn't be interested at this moment
[6:25 PM] fancy: it cannot exist without its precursor
[6:25 PM] HaxJester: well, situational interest more acts as an extension to that tbh
[6:26 PM] HaxJester: cus you will not consider all the whys in a situation that you'd aim to get into
[6:26 PM] HaxJester: like you go for a walk
[6:26 PM] fancy: wait
[6:26 PM] fancy: wait

[6:26 PM] fancy: wait
[6:26 PM] fancy: hold up
[6:26 PM] HaxJester: you cannot predict everyone who you'll see
[6:26 PM] HaxJester: so your personal interest was planning to go for the walk
[6:26 PM] HaxJester: then the situational interest arise from what you encounter during your walk when you actually go for said walk
[6:27 PM] HaxJester: which stemmed from a combination of your personal, individual, and whatever other interest
[6:27 PM] HaxJester: and then what happens now is
[6:28 PM] HaxJester: if what you see in the situational interest enhanced your experience, you're more likely to repeat the activity
[6:28 PM] fancy: what does the phrase "in the situational interest" mean
[6:28 PM] fancy: you can't be "in" an interest
[6:28 PM] fancy: you have interests
[6:28 PM] fancy: you aren't "in" them
[6:28 PM] HaxJester: what you see in
[6:29 PM] fancy: that does not clarify
[6:29 PM] HaxJester: ok, does this sentence make sense
[6:29 PM] HaxJester: "what do you see interesting about x"
[6:29 PM] fancy: sure
[6:29 PM] fancy: because of the implied stuff that's missing, yes
[6:30 PM] HaxJester: that's how I'm using the phrase "what you see in the situational interest" here
[6:30 PM] fancy: so you're saying "the interesting stuff you see on your walk can enhance your experience..."
[6:30 PM] fancy: more or less
[6:30 PM] HaxJester: yeah
[6:30 PM] fancy: ok so
[6:30 PM] fancy: what I say about that is
[6:30 PM] fancy: anything that you perceive as situationally interesting
[6:31 PM] fancy: while on your walk
[6:31 PM] fancy: only is interesting to you because of your interest in a generalized topic of things
[6:31 PM] fancy: would you agree with that
[6:31 PM] fancy: to illustrate:
[6:31 PM] fancy: you see a cool bird
[6:31 PM] fancy: you find it interesting
[6:32 PM] fancy: you find it interesting because you really like birds
[6:32 PM] fancy: if you didn't like birds, maybe you don't find it interesting at all
[6:32 PM] HaxJester: so kinda like that
[6:32 PM] fancy: substitute "likes birds" for any other base reason
[6:32 PM] HaxJester: but not as restricted
[6:32 PM] HaxJester: it can be like
[6:32 PM] HaxJester: you see a cool bird that you find interesting
[6:32 PM] HaxJester: because you like the vibrant colors on its feather
[6:33 PM] HaxJester: you started out liking the colors then now you like birds
[6:33 PM] HaxJester: thus the separation
[6:33 PM] fancy: I don't see that as a separation, just a discovery of a new aspect of something you didn't consider before
[6:33 PM] fancy: because look at it this way
[6:33 PM] HaxJester: yeah
[6:33 PM] fancy: if birds weren't colourful
[6:33 PM] fancy: would you like them?
[6:33 PM] fancy: probably not
[6:33 PM] fancy: so you're really still interested in the colours, not the bird
[6:33 PM] HaxJester: situational interest can very well be discovery of new aspects on your personal interest
[6:34 PM] fancy: but the situational interest was really just your interest in colours leading you to pay attention to something that maybe you don't normally
[6:34 PM] fancy: so it's basically just an extension of another persistent interest
[6:35 PM] HaxJester: I mean, if that's the act of extending it
[6:35 PM] HaxJester: wouldn't that act alone qualify it as a new segment?
[6:35 PM] fancy: I don't believe so
[6:35 PM] fancy: because the base interest is still "colours"
[6:35 PM] fancy: it's just you realized "birds have colours too"
[6:36 PM] fancy: but it's still all about colours
[6:36 PM] fancy: you don't suddenly start caring about how they fly
[6:36 PM] fancy: or their mating patterns
[6:36 PM] fancy: or etc
[6:36 PM] fancy: unless you also have an interest in those things, which would indicate that you had a predisposition towards that interest in the first place
[6:36 PM] fancy: follow?
[6:36 PM] HaxJester: I mean the process here was clear cut, but if it was not, how else would you classify it
[6:37 PM] HaxJester: cus that's basically how there are all these classifications
[6:37 PM] fancy: I wouldn't, all interest seems the same to me at this point
[6:37 PM] HaxJester: like say you're interested in this bird while you're on this walk
[6:37 PM] HaxJester: but you don't know which personal or individual interest it stemmed from
[6:37 PM] HaxJester: how else would you classify it?
[6:37 PM] HaxJester: cus it surely doesn't belong to either of those
[6:37 PM] HaxJester: so they give it a new word
[6:37 PM] fancy: sure, but that doesn't make it different
[6:38 PM] fancy: just like because they didn't figure out in that moment
[6:38 PM] HaxJester: well, the difference is not in what you call it
[6:38 PM] HaxJester: the difference is what you can later do with it
[6:38 PM] HaxJester: so if you don't plan for the latter, then sure, they're all the same
[6:38 PM] fancy: wait
[6:38 PM] fancy: what's the difference in what you can do later
[6:38 PM] fancy: elaborate on that
[6:39 PM] HaxJester: if we establish a hierarchy between these
situational < personal < individual
[6:39 PM] fancy: that's a big if, since I currently believe it's all the same
[6:39 PM] fancy: but go on
[6:39 PM] HaxJester: you can control the situation more by hitting on what's higher in the hierarchy
[6:40 PM] fancy: are you speaking as to
[6:40 PM] fancy: if you know someone else's interests?
[6:42 PM] HaxJester: so let's say our scenario worked out to be
situational - saw an interesting colorful bird on a walk
personal (related) - want to get an art degree (interest in color scheme)
individual - want to be a popular artist
[6:43 PM] fancy: mhmm
[6:43 PM] HaxJester: when you ask someone about "how was your walk"
[6:44 PM] HaxJester: they'll tell you about the bird, but not the art degree or their desire to be a popular artist
[6:44 PM] HaxJester: you can try to convince them that the bird isn't interesting, but they'll argue back at most, due to the personal interest
[6:44 PM] fancy: wait why would I try that
[6:44 PM] fancy: lol
[6:44 PM] HaxJester: not saying you would do that, but that is what will happen
[6:45 PM] fancy: well yeah they'll argue back, because they did find it interesting
[6:45 PM] HaxJester: but if you if reduce the interest in being popular, then you will also reduce their interest in getting an art degree, and also reducing their interest in the colorful bird
[6:45 PM] fancy: that's nothing new
[6:45 PM] fancy: wait what
[6:45 PM] fancy: oh ok
[6:45 PM] fancy: I follow
[6:45 PM] HaxJester: thus the hierarchy
[6:45 PM] fancy: right but so
[6:45 PM] fancy: what I'm saying is
[6:45 PM] fancy: they're not really interested in the bird
[6:45 PM] fancy: or in colours
[6:45 PM] fancy: or in an art degree
[6:45 PM] HaxJester: sure
[6:46 PM] HaxJester: but both them and you don't know that
[6:46 PM] fancy: how is that relevant?
[6:46 PM] HaxJester: like you don't know that they want to be popular
[6:46 PM] fancy: the facts don't change based on whether we are aware of them
[6:46 PM] fancy: well sure, but that's still the reason why
[6:46 PM] HaxJester: sometimes even the person themselves doesn't know that
[6:46 PM] fancy: correct
[6:46 PM] fancy: I am aware of this
[6:47 PM] fancy: most people don't know why they do/like things
[6:47 PM] HaxJester: but that interest at the individual level will affect all lower levels
[6:47 PM] HaxJester: and you can affect their decision making
[6:47 PM] fancy: because most people never think about it
[6:47 PM] fancy: ...right
[6:47 PM] fancy: and my point was
[6:48 PM] fancy: the only thing that really exists is the highest level of interest
[6:48 PM] fancy: it's just how it manifests
[6:48 PM] HaxJester: I mean sure, but from a practical point of view
[6:48 PM] HaxJester: it's also more difficult to obtain that information the higher you go
[6:48 PM] fancy: yes
[6:48 PM] fancy: but that doesn't change what reality is
[6:48 PM] HaxJester: yeah, you can call it interest 1 2 3
[6:48 PM] fancy: so the situational interest in the bird
[6:49 PM] fancy: isn't an interest in the bird
[6:49 PM] fancy: it doesn't exist
[6:49 PM] HaxJester: and the division in application still exists
[6:50 PM] fancy: it's one concept seen at three levels of removal
[6:50 PM] fancy: aka
[6:50 PM] fancy: they all reduce to the same interest
[6:50 PM] HaxJester: sure
[6:50 PM] HaxJester: you can call it that way too
[6:51 PM] fancy: yeah I just don't see the value in having 3 terms for the same thing
[6:51 PM] HaxJester: situational removal, personal removal, individual removal
[6:51 PM] fancy: but maybe these articles don't explain that very well
[6:51 PM] fancy: cus that seems intuitively redundant
[6:51 PM] HaxJester: honestly the way the hostage negotiator guy applies this is probably the best explanation
[6:51 PM] fancy: it actually hits on some things that have bothered me for a while actually
[6:52 PM] HaxJester: he doesn't directly uses the terms but I saw this and I was like
[6:52 PM] HaxJester: wait
[6:52 PM] HaxJester: this is exactly the entire basis behind how that hostage negotiator guy negotiates
[6:52 PM] fancy: yeah you just need to know what people really want
[6:52 PM] fancy: or value
[6:52 PM] fancy: or etc
[6:53 PM] fancy: which can be hard to figure out
[6:53 PM] fancy: cus most people aren't open about it
[6:53 PM] fancy: cus
[6:53 PM] fancy: reasons
[6:53 PM] fancy: i guess
[6:53 PM] fancy: lol
[6:54 PM] HaxJester: aite go get your PhD in communication psychology now
[6:54 PM] fancy: no thx
[6:54 PM] HaxJester: you have more material to go off on than most people have on their PhD papers
[6:54 PM] fancy: don't like that game
[6:54 PM] fancy: :poppo:
[6:54 PM] fancy: school is for weenies
