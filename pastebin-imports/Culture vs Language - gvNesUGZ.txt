3:33 PM]Yoshi/s:Do you think the language we speak at least impart defies our perception of reality
[3:37 PM]pizza:yes
[3:38 PM]pizza:i think your thoughts and the language in which you think can change the way you perceive and interpret things
[3:38 PM]pizza:not to the extent of Arrival, where she learns alien language and perceives time in a non-linear fashion, but you know
[3:48 PM]Coeurdleon:or the fact that people will regard objects wdifferently when their language defines them as gendered, like some people will refer to a bridge as beautiful and other as strong because bridge might be feminine in their language but masculine in anthe other
[3:54 PM]fancy:what's arrival
[3:55 PM]Coeurdleon:another movie
[3:55 PM]fancy:ah
[3:55 PM]fancy:I think it has way more to do with culture and social norms
[3:55 PM]fancy:language is more a manifestation of that and not the root cause
[3:56 PM]Coeurdleon:language and culture have undeniable interplay
[3:56 PM]fancy:I don't think language makes culture
[3:56 PM]fancy:I'm pretty sure culture dictates language
[3:56 PM]Coeurdleon:no, but language is how culture is ocmmunicated
[3:57 PM]fancy:yeah but it's the product
[3:57 PM]fancy:it's the manifestation
[3:57 PM]fancy:not really the cause
[3:57 PM]fancy:it's just a tool
[3:57 PM]Coeurdleon:i dont think you can really divorce the two
[3:57 PM]fancy:by itself it doesn't really do anything
[3:57 PM]fancy:I don't think American culture would radically change if we all happened to have spoken Russian instead or something
[3:57 PM]fancy:or klingon
[3:58 PM]fancy:I don't think there's anything inherent to specific sounds of a language unless you want to delve into some musicality-oriented approach
[3:58 PM]fancy:because certain languages sound nice to the ear or something
[4:00 PM]fancy:I'm not saying that language and culture aren't linked
[4:00 PM]fancy:but I'm saying that language is the effector in this scenario
[4:00 PM]Coeurdleon:hold on im appealing to authority right now
[4:00 PM]fancy:so I don't think I'd credit language with the responsibility of dictating perspective
[4:06 PM]fancy:I suppose an exception would be in reading a written or hearing a spoken record of an event or something
[4:06 PM]fancy:because then the chosen wording does affect what you think because it's all you know
[4:07 PM]fancy:but I'm unsure if that would change how I understood the event based on whether I said "Julian killed himself with a grenade" in English Spanish Russian or french
[4:09 PM]Coeurdleon:so the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis states that language influences how you think
[4:09 PM]Coeurdleon:which directly influences how cultures develop, but culture also in turn influences language
[4:10 PM]Coeurdleon:the degree to which the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is correct is debated
[4:11 PM]fancy:I'd argue culture existed before language
[4:11 PM]Coeurdleon:I'd argue that you cant have culture without communication which is by definition language
[4:11 PM]fancy:uh not always
[4:12 PM]fancy:unless you consider all forms of conveying ideas to be a language
[4:12 PM]fancy:even implicitly conveying ideas
[4:13 PM]fancy:would you say that animals can't have culture?
[4:14 PM]Coeurdleon:going by dictionary definitions, language is structured communication and culture is the appretiation of human intellectual achievement
[4:15 PM]Coeurdleon:i'd say that without structured communication you can't develop culture
[4:15 PM]fancy:how loose a structure is allowed
[4:17 PM]fancy:what about animals that communicate via howls, snarls, barks, hisses, etc
[4:17 PM]fancy:is that structured communication
[4:18 PM]Coeurdleon:i would say animals dont have culture because they cannot appreciate anything beyond satisfying their basic needs
[4:23 PM]fancy:right
[4:23 PM]fancy:but that wasn't the question
[4:24 PM]fancy:I guess to back up even further
[4:24 PM]fancy:what if you could express ideas and feelings directly onto another person's mind
[4:25 PM]fancy:could you have culture then
[4:28 PM]Coeurdleon:can you percieve complex thoughts, ideas, and feelings without a means of communicating them?
[4:28 PM]fancy:definitely
[4:28 PM]fancy:take colours for example
[4:29 PM]fancy:there are millions of potential colours
[4:29 PM]fancy:and we don't have words to describe any significant number of them
[4:29 PM]fancy:we can still perceive them though
[4:29 PM]fancy:and that's a really simple example
[4:29 PM]fancy:there's lots of really complicated emotions you can feel
[4:29 PM]fancy:that can be extremely difficult to communicate
[4:29 PM]fancy:but you still feel them
[4:30 PM]fancy:see: every teenager ever
[4:32 PM]Coeurdleon:you can have emotions without having culture. and colors can be described numerically
[4:33 PM]fancy:but you asked if you could have these things
[4:33 PM]fancy:even higher level concepts you can understand without having the right words
[4:33 PM]fancy:see badger
[4:34 PM]fancy:he's real bad at finding the right words for a lot of things
[4:43 PM]Coeurdleon:retrospectively, my question has little to do with my argument, and as humans cannot convey information to each other without comprehensible communication, your vulcan mind meld scenario isn't applicable to reality.
[4:43 PM]fancy:well currently
[4:44 PM]fancy:but the point of the question was to actually determine if language is prerequisite to culture
[4:45 PM]Coeurdleon:theyre not prerequites to each other. im pretty sure they developed mutually as human intellectual capacity reached critical thought
[4:46 PM]fancy:could you have culture develop in societies that never spoke
[4:46 PM]Coeurdleon:societies that never speak would still have a method of communication\
[4:47 PM]fancy:what about one that didn't involve traditional language
[4:47 PM]fancy:ie. written or spoken words
[4:47 PM]Coeurdleon:im not going to define language
[4:48 PM]Coeurdleon:because i dont have the education or authority
[4:50 PM]Coeurdleon:but as i understand it, you cannot develop communities without structured communication of some form and culture requires collective thought
[4:51 PM]fancy:okay so back to the structured communication question
[4:51 PM]fancy:how "structured" is structured
[4:53 PM]Coeurdleon:structured would be mutually understood, and is retrospectively redundant
[4:54 PM]fancy:so could animals have structured communication
[4:55 PM]Coeurdleon:by that definition, yes
[4:55 PM]Coeurdleon:so i guess i can logically conclude
[4:55 PM]Coeurdleon:that in my opinion you can have communication without cultur
[4:56 PM]pizza:Many scientists think that the reason humanity became the dominant species over neanderthals because we were able to communicate better
[4:56 PM]fancy:okay
[4:56 PM]fancy:so
[4:56 PM]pizza:Perhaps unrelated but still
[4:56 PM]pizza:I agree with Julian
[4:56 PM]pizza:They’re mutual
[4:56 PM]fancy:next facet
[4:57 PM]fancy:or construction
[4:57 PM]fancy:or whatever
[4:57 PM]fancy:a single person cannot have culture, correct?
[4:57 PM]pizza:A single person who was raised in a chamber
[4:57 PM]Coeurdleon:no, as ive defined it as collective thought
[4:57 PM]pizza:Yeah I agree
[4:57 PM]fancy:okay good
[4:58 PM]fancy:what about two people
[4:58 PM]fancy:can a society of two people have a culture among them
[4:58 PM]pizza:*between
[4:58 PM]Coeurdleon:sure, if they both develop an appreciation for something beyond its ability to promote life, then yes
[4:59 PM]fancy:no among get out
[4:59 PM]pizza:Among is more than two
[4:59 PM]fancy:and wait a second
[4:59 PM]fancy:uh not necessarily
[4:59 PM]fancy:but
[4:59 PM]fancy:to Julian
[5:00 PM]Coeurdleon:4.
indicating a division, choice, or differentiation involving three or more participants.
[5:00 PM]Coeurdleon:among ^
[5:01 PM]Coeurdleon:anyyway continue
[5:01 PM]fancy:and the first three definitions don't mention number
[5:01 PM]fancy:moving on
[5:02 PM]fancy:i suppose I should ask you to define culture
[5:02 PM]fancy:or what you think culture means in this context first
[5:03 PM]Coeurdleon:i said it was collective appreciation for something beyond its basic ablility to support your life earlier, i believe or something along those lines.
[5:04 PM]fancy:hmm
[5:04 PM]fancy:I don't think that definition is really useful to this topic then
[5:04 PM]fancy:unless you expand on what you mean by appreciation
[5:05 PM]Coeurdleon:maybe something closer to critical collective thought about something beyond direct biological impact
[5:06 PM]fancy:I'd just say it's collectively held ideas, beliefs, or customs
[5:07 PM]fancy:but okay that works I thiiink
[5:08 PM]pizza:I think arrival actually had a great metaphor for this
[5:08 PM]pizza:Where some languages use the same word for tool and weapon
[5:08 PM]pizza:Whereas other languages differentiate between the two
[5:09 PM]pizza:And how that actually affects people’s perception of various “tools”
[5:09 PM]fancy:hmm
[5:09 PM]pizza:Or “weapons”
[5:19 PM]fancy:you don't
[5:19 PM]fancy:and there is no consequence
[5:20 PM]pizza:Oh preplanted people aren’t really experiment
[5:20 PM]pizza:Kk hmm
[5:20 PM]fancy:yes
[5:21 PM]fancy:@Coeurdleon so what's the difference between collective thought and culture
[5:21 PM]pizza:why would they though. If there’s no consequence and no communication there’s no reason to stand. There’s no significance to it, and the concept of peer pressure might not even exist to these blank slates
[5:21 PM]Coeurdleon:culture develops when collective thoughts agree
[5:22 PM]pizza:And if you say that following crowd is an innate thing, then I’d argue that standing at the beep isn’t a culture
[5:22 PM]pizza:Because it’s following an innate built in thing
[5:22 PM]pizza:When you enter room and see 100 people standing at beep you’re probably coded to not stand out
[5:22 PM]fancy:it's not that severe
[5:22 PM]fancy:it starts as like
[5:22 PM]pizza:Animals who are stragglers and who stand out get kicked off
[5:22 PM]fancy:I'd have to look it up
[5:22 PM]pizza:*picked
[5:25 PM]fancy:ah okay
[5:25 PM]fancy:si
[5:25 PM]fancy:so
[5:25 PM]fancy:the people are called out of the room one by one
[5:26 PM]fancy:and even down to the last person alone
[5:26 PM]fancy:they all continue to stand for the tone
[5:26 PM]fancy:so I don't think you can make a peer pressure argument for this
[5:26 PM]pizza:Wait so the experiment starts as you said and then after that they take people out one by one
[5:26 PM]fancy:yeah it's a waiting room
[5:27 PM]fancy:and they get called in for the "experiment" one by one
[5:27 PM]fancy:as they filter through
[5:27 PM]fancy:but the real experiment is the waiting room
[5:28 PM]pizza:I think the paradox of this is that it’s non organic. You’re injecting culture by having a control group of people stand at the beep.
[5:28 PM]fancy:@Coeurdleon what is a collective thought that isn't culture
[5:28 PM]pizza:St least; that’s where I struggle to grasp this as organic culture without language
[5:28 PM]Coeurdleon:If anything, i would argue that the fact that everyone does it without question implies that its an ingrained response, not critical thought
[5:28 PM]fancy:I don't see how that is an argument
[5:28 PM]fancy:a lot of cultural developments are just as arbitrary
[5:29 PM]fancy:like why are women's buttons on the right
[5:29 PM]fancy:and men's on the left
[5:29 PM]fancy:that's a cultural thing
[5:29 PM]pizza:Because someone in the long time ago said that that’s the way
[5:29 PM]Coeurdleon:Its so that women dress men and themselves the same way
[5:29 PM]fancy:isn't that just as arbitrary
[5:30 PM]fancy:what if the experiment originally shocked the first 6 people to teach them to stand
[5:30 PM]fancy:and not the rest
[5:30 PM]fancy:but the rest keep standing anyway
[5:30 PM]pizza:Then that’s a survival response aka not culture
[5:30 PM]fancy:or something like that
[5:30 PM]fancy:not for the later people
[5:30 PM]fancy:it's still just as arbitrary
[5:30 PM]pizza:I think the odds that the six people who get shocked wouldn’t make a sound at the new people who didn’t stand is unlikely
[5:30 PM]fancy:they're not allowed
[5:30 PM]pizza:They’d make sounds or something when the other new person didn’t stand
[5:31 PM]fancy:that's the point
[5:31 PM]pizza:Like they can’t make sound at all then?
[5:31 PM]pizza:Or look
[5:31 PM]fancy:no
[5:31 PM]pizza:I don’t understand
[5:31 PM]Coeurdleon:Two people disagreeing on something would imply they they have collectively though about something and reached different conclusions. That would not be culture.
[5:31 PM]pizza:They can’t communicate but they can look around okay
[5:31 PM]pizza:Hmm
[5:32 PM]fancy:it's originally an experiment on social conformity
[5:32 PM]fancy:which is why it's set up this way
[5:32 PM]fancy:there's no reason for a lone person who's never been told anything about standing to keep standing after they are alone
[5:32 PM]fancy:except they do
[5:32 PM]fancy:and they can propogate that forward
[5:32 PM]fancy:all without speaking
[5:32 PM]fancy:it communicating
[5:33 PM]pizza:I think jumping to the conclusion that the first person to get pulled out will still stand at the beep is a bit meh
[5:33 PM]fancy:just because it's "inorganic" doesn't make it not cultural
[5:33 PM]fancy:what
[5:33 PM]fancy:rephrase that
[5:33 PM]fancy:I'm not jumping anywhere that's what happened
[5:33 PM]fancy:one person was left alone in the room after the rest have been called
[5:33 PM]fancy:not one of the originals
[5:33 PM]fancy:the ones told to stand
[5:34 PM]fancy:and she continued to stand for the tone
[5:34 PM]fancy:in a presumably empty room
[5:34 PM]fancy:she didn't even know she was on camera
[5:34 PM]fancy:that's more or less a culture in my book
[5:34 PM]pizza:Wait this is an actual experiment with regular people?
[5:34 PM]fancy:yes
[5:34 PM]pizza:Then this doesn’t work at all
[5:34 PM]fancy:what did you think it was lol
[5:34 PM]pizza:Because they already have culture
[5:34 PM]Coeurdleon:You also can't deny pre-existing cultural baggage
[5:34 PM]pizza:I thought this was theory
[5:34 PM]pizza:Yeah exactly
[5:34 PM]pizza:That adds a whole new layer
[5:35 PM]fancy:no...
[5:35 PM]pizza:We’re already conditioned to do as others do
[5:35 PM]fancy:because the argument was that you don't need language
[5:35 PM]fancy:that was my whole point
[5:36 PM]Coeurdleon:There no culture being developed, people already have been trained to not stand out, its just a specific aspect of their culture being called upon
[5:36 PM]fancy:so why stand when she's alone
[5:36 PM]fancy:and why propogate that forward
[5:37 PM]fancy:that parts theory idk if you could take one person and then re-add a whole new room of people and have them keep standing I'd be interested in that
[5:37 PM]pizza:Because we know how studies and experiments work. And we’re pattern seeking. There’s no reason to stop standing at beep when we established it as the norm before.
[5:37 PM]fancy:but why stand when she's alone then
[5:37 PM]Coeurdleon:Because she has nothing telling her  to stop
[5:38 PM]pizza:Why should she stop what she’s doing as the last person when there’s nothing telling her to stop
[5:38 PM]Coeurdleon:But she has been shown to stand
[5:38 PM]fancy:so by that logic she'd keep standing as you add more people	
[5:38 PM]fancy:how is this not a culture
[5:39 PM]fancy:because if you call that not a culture then every popular fad isn't culture either
[5:39 PM]fancy:by extension
[5:39 PM]fancy:because that's just following the crowds
[5:39 PM]fancy:something you said is done naturally
[5:40 PM]fancy:and therefore not culture
[5:40 PM]fancy:no?
[5:40 PM]Yoshi/s:Wouldn't it be better to look on cases of language deprevtion
[5:40 PM]fancy:explain
[5:41 PM]fancy:this is basically language deprivation in the instance of this experiment
[5:41 PM]fancy:they're explicitly not allowed to communicate
[5:41 PM]Yoshi/s:I mean there are actual cases in of language deprevation
[5:42 PM]Yoshi/s:Like they never learn a language in the first place
[5:42 PM]fancy:isn't that really hard to explore because of ethics
[5:43 PM]pizza:Reminds me of Harry Harlow monkey experiments
[5:44 PM]fancy:I think most cases of this don't really lend itself to this discussion because it's a single individual that has been deprived of language and not a group
[5:44 PM]fancy:so you can't really see a cultural development there
[5:45 PM]fancy:but again I'd ask what makes the social conformity experiment different from any other cultural development
[5:45 PM]fancy:aside from scale
[5:49 PM]fancy:Because I'd argue that both are cultural
[5:50 PM]fancy:and even many animal behaviors, especially primate, are also cultural
[5:52 PM]fancy:and it seems very much that the particular method of conveying these cultural behaviors and ideas doesn't matter
[5:52 PM]fancy:but the specific ideas and behaviors do
[5:52 PM]Coeurdleon:Id say that language and culture are products of higher level thought in a social environment
[5:53 PM]fancy:what is higher level thought
[5:54 PM]Coeurdleon:Critical thought that goes beyond survival or basic instinct
[5:54 PM]fancy:I'd disagree with that being a definition of culture
[5:54 PM]Coeurdleon:Then we agree to disagree
[5:54 PM]fancy:what about teaching
[5:55 PM]fancy:is teaching a higher level thought process
[5:55 PM]fancy:or concept
[5:56 PM]Coeurdleon:If its for the basic process of survival, no. Birds teaching their young to fly is not culture. Its their primary tool of survival
[5:58 PM]Coeurdleon:Apes teaching their young to use a stick to get bugs out of cracks in trees is another example of acting out of survival instinct
[5:59 PM]Coeurdleon:Or teaching their young to clean bigger stronger apes so they dont get thrown out of the pack is also survival, not culture
[6:00 PM]fancy:so
[6:00 PM]fancy:I could extrapolate all these arguments
[6:00 PM]fancy:to basically every human instance of "culture"
[6:00 PM]fancy:under the pretense of fitting in and not getting exiled for example
[6:01 PM]fancy:or workplace culture being in the interest of survival
[6:02 PM]fancy:it's one thing if everyone learned this independently but the act of relaying these things from generation to generation or amongst peers I'd what I'd call an aspect of culture
[6:02 PM]fancy:an ape living alone learning to use sticks to get food and then having an offspring but the mother and father dies and then the offspring has to relearn the same thing etc
[6:03 PM]fancy:wouldn't be culture for example
[6:03 PM]fancy:but a mother and father are teaching their offspring and their peers how to use sticks would be culture
[6:03 PM]fancy:I think you're defining it as an end product rather than a process
[6:04 PM]fancy:though there are probably elements of both
[6:04 PM]fancy:but I think the implication is that whatever culture exists in a group is intended to be shared amongst all members continually
