[12:19 PM] fancy: like iceiceice
[12:20 PM] A Random Badger: ye i doubt ill get anything like that lol
[12:20 PM] A Random Badger: im just sick of not being able to have game impact and it makes the game so incredibly boring how you have almost no control over any of it and i feel like thats just how offlane is rn
[12:21 PM] A Random Badger: beginning of 7.0 offlane was uber fun and had tons of impact it felt like
[12:21 PM] A Random Badger: even 6.88 it felt like you had some impact
[12:21 PM] A Random Badger: this meta feels like theres just no offlane impact
[12:21 PM] A Random Badger: and it makes the game super boring
[12:22 PM] fancy: what
[12:23 PM] fancy: the current meta is full of great off lanes
[12:24 PM] fancy: furion brood mk veno necro pugna ns puckp
[12:24 PM] fancy: off lane duals
[12:24 PM] fancy: 1v1s
[12:24 PM] fancy: etc
[12:24 PM] A Random Badger: well taw meta doesnt like that ig cause i dont get to play those
[12:25 PM] A Random Badger: i play the "just exist" offlaners
[12:25 PM] fancy: more like
[12:25 PM] fancy: no one can draft
[12:25 PM] A Random Badger: ig
[12:25 PM] A Random Badger: and i dont feel like putting in the effort at this point to learn how to
[12:25 PM] A Random Badger: when pizza would rather draft anyways
[12:25 PM] A Random Badger: or ant
[12:26 PM] fancy: people didn't let me draft until I showed I was good at it
[12:26 PM] fancy: :thumbsup:
[12:26 PM] A Random Badger: yes but you dont start good at it
[12:26 PM] fancy: I didn't either
[12:26 PM] A Random Badger: you do it once, you do bad, you're not allowed again
[12:26 PM] fancy: I was bad
[12:27 PM] A Random Badger: ye but you probably had a team where no one else was interested in drafting anyways
[12:27 PM] fancy: not really
[12:27 PM] fancy: I had redman
[12:27 PM] fancy: or havin
[12:27 PM] fancy: I've only been on alpha and bravo
[12:28 PM] A Random Badger: either way no point now when we'll be getting drastically new meta in like a week when dualing fates drops
[12:28 PM] fancy: it's not about meta as much as fundamentals tho
[12:29 PM] A Random Badger: and i dont really have/want time to commit to learn meta and drafting over work and relaxing and playing stuff
[12:30 PM] A Random Badger: not to mention the time to elarn these offlane heroes well enough to be able to do something with them
[12:35 PM] fancy: idk
[12:35 PM] fancy: everything worth doing takes time
[12:37 PM] fancy: I don't really understand not wanting to put effort into anything
[12:37 PM] fancy: but that's cus like I don't understand enjoying things that don't require effort
[12:40 PM] A Random Badger: because i dont find drafting enjoyable, i would only be doing it so i could draft myself stuff that could allow me to have fun, so learning how to draft would just be stressful and would i rather be stressed over the short period of free time i have to do something or would i rather be doing something i find enjoyable
[12:40 PM] A Random Badger: if i had a larger span of time to be able to say, ill spend this amount of time learning how to draft and when i get tired of that ill call it a day and do something fun i would
[12:41 PM] fancy: you're thinking about it too much
[12:41 PM] fancy: and in like all the wrong ways
[12:42 PM] fancy: it's not stressful because there are no stakes
[12:42 PM] fancy: you don't particularly care about winning like I do
[12:44 PM] A Random Badger: the stakes are my enjoyment and level of anxiety tho
[12:45 PM] fancy: feelings are just feelings
[12:45 PM] fancy: doesn't mean they're accurate
[12:45 PM] fancy: the only reason you don't enjoy it is because you decide to stress about it
[12:45 PM] fancy: and you decide that means you can't enjoy it
[12:46 PM] fancy: I stress about things all the time but I still can enjoy them
[12:46 PM] fancy: it's a matter of realizing you're having those feelings and letting them pass
[12:46 PM] fancy: if you were to have a better draft and a better chance of winning and doing well because you're not disadvantaged at the start
[12:47 PM] fancy: you'd have an easier time enjoying the game
[12:47 PM] fancy: but you don't want to put that prerequisite effort in because you'd rather take the pain you know
[12:47 PM] fancy: i. e. suffering through a game on a boring hero with a bad draft
[12:47 PM] fancy: than the pain you don't know
[12:48 PM] fancy: i. e. trying to figure out how to draft around your goon squad
