[4:05 PM] Subhanshu: Sports are the exact same way
[4:05 PM] fancy: And art
[4:05 PM] Subhanshu: Except with sports it's even less likely
[4:05 PM] fancy: And speaking
[4:05 PM] fancy: And politicians
[4:05 PM] fancy: And etc
[4:05 PM] fancy: You have to be in the upper echelon of skill for whatever you do for it to be profitable
[4:06 PM] fancy: That's why I'm in retail and not professionally gaming
[4:06 PM] fancy: Even though games are my passion
[4:08 PM] fancy: They aren't any more harmful than Netflix or disc golf or social drinking
[4:08 PM] Suck it, Moto!: You could be the best csgo carry and caller ever, but no conventional employer is going to give a shit. However they will give a shit if you were captain of a college football team. Both positions display leadership skills, but hard reality is few people appreciate videogames as a platform to learn and display useful life skills
[4:08 PM] fancy: None of those things encourage productivity but there's a limit to how much people can work without enjoying themselves
[4:09 PM] fancy: That could be said for everything at different points in time
[4:09 PM] Subhanshu: To counter that Andrew employers will care if you actually led a team to a major
[4:09 PM] fancy: Yeah
[4:09 PM] fancy: It's about how you present it
[4:09 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Yeah. No they wouldnt
[4:10 PM] fancy: That's factually false Andrew
[4:10 PM] Subhanshu: If you're just w good player and a good caller that's the same as saying you're really good at flag football
[4:10 PM] fancy: I got my first job in part due to my tf2 team
[4:10 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I said best caller and carry ever
[4:10 PM] fancy: That's not the same as a leader
[4:10 PM] fancy: I wouldn't hire some star football player to manage people
[4:10 PM] Subhanshu: ^^^
[4:10 PM] fancy: I'd hire a star captain
[4:11 PM] fancy: Being IGL is one of the most difficult things from what I hear
[4:11 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I SAID CAPTAIN YOU DOLT
[4:11 PM] fancy: You said caller and carry
[4:11 PM] Subhanshu: ^
[4:11 PM] fancy: Mr ad hominem(edited)
[4:11 PM] Subhanshu: Captain of a CSGO team who went to the major
[4:11 PM] Subhanshu: Would matter
[4:12 PM] Suck it, Moto!: It doest matter if the interviewers has never heard of csgo and doesnt care about it
[4:12 PM] fancy: Especially if you explain what that entails
[4:12 PM] fancy: Which also demonstrates another useful skill
[4:12 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Whereas virtually everyone understands sports captains are valuable
[4:12 PM] Subhanshu: Also if you made money people would care
[4:12 PM] fancy: That's just a product of culture
[4:13 PM] fancy: I'm sure at some point no one gve two fucks about high school sports
[4:13 PM] fancy: But society evolves
[4:13 PM] fancy: I sure as hell would hire a csgo captain
[4:13 PM] Suck it, Moto!: There is no fucking point to talking about this.
[4:13 PM] fancy: In 15 years I very well could be in a position to
[4:14 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Fine when that time comes you can become 1 piece of anecdotal data
[4:14 PM] fancy: I don't know what chip you have on your shoulder about this
[4:14 PM] fancy: You're trying to invalidate a hobby by calling it pointless
[4:14 PM] fancy: Because it isn't professionally relevant(edited)
[4:15 PM] Subhanshu: What you're saying about videogames captains vs sport captains is partially true but that's also because esports are only now becoming serious
[4:15 PM] Subhanshu: Few years
[4:15 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Not what im saying. If you enjoy it, there is a point.  But it's relatively fruitless compared to other mainstream hobbies
[4:15 PM] fancy: What does that even mean
[4:15 PM] fancy: All hobbies have the same point
[4:15 PM] fancy: They're entertainment
[4:15 PM] fancy: They're the part of life you enjoy
[4:16 PM] fancy: Like, we're not living to work
[4:16 PM] fancy: We're working to live
[4:16 PM] Subhanshu: But to address mainstream hobbies
[4:16 PM] Subhanshu: What do you think is mainstream that is more lucrative?
[4:17 PM] fancy: If your only complaint is that the older generations don't recognize the value and skills gained in a team competitive gaming environment yet(edited)
[4:17 PM] fancy: The same was true for everything we currently value
[4:17 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Than videogames? Sports, dancing, academic clubs. Literally anything that gets you outside or talking to people face to face. Things that force you to meet new peole
[4:17 PM] fancy: Like scientists and sports players and inventors and etc
[4:18 PM] fancy: So you're saying that meeting some random kid in dance club would have been any different than me meeting Subhanshu
[4:19 PM] fancy: He's one of the best things ever to happen to my life, as annoying as he is
[4:19 PM] fancy: It happened through games
[4:19 PM] fancy: It's just another outlet for interaction
[4:19 PM] fancy: It's not less real because it's online
[4:19 PM] fancy: That's a backwards way to think
[4:19 PM] fancy: Yes if you spend all your time never going outside that's a problem
[4:19 PM] fancy: Just like if all you ever did was play soccer that's a problem
[4:20 PM] fancy: It's balance
[4:20 PM] fancy: It's moderation
[4:20 PM] fancy: I've met plenty of girls in real life
[4:20 PM] fancy: I got to know several
[4:20 PM] fancy: None of them were as real as me and Ashley
[4:20 PM] Suck it, Moto!: But none that actually matter in the end right?
[4:20 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Yeah
[4:21 PM] fancy: It's not because of the medium
[4:21 PM] fancy: It's because of the people involved
[4:21 PM] fancy: I'm going to meet more people like me while doing the things I enjoy
[4:21 PM] fancy: I am not going to meet people with a passion for gaming going to Frisbee club
[4:21 PM] fancy: I'm not going to meet people like me going to parties
[4:21 PM] fancy: In general
[4:21 PM] fancy: Keep in mind
[4:22 PM] fancy: Is it inherently better to meet someone at a party or a club for something that you have no interest in
[4:22 PM] fancy: Just because it's in person?
[4:23 PM] fancy: Just because you maybe don't enjoy games as much or for the same reasons doesn't invalidate them as a concept
[4:23 PM] fancy: Just because your interests line up with people that go out more than people that stay in, doesn't mean the people that stay in are gimped
[4:24 PM] fancy: Like think about the friends you have from frats and college
[4:24 PM] fancy: How many do you think I would get along with?
[4:24 PM] Suck it, Moto!: literally none of them
[4:24 PM] fancy: Yet here I am with some of the best friends I could have asked for
[4:25 PM] fancy: And I didn't have to go anywhere outside for that
[4:25 PM] Suck it, Moto!: you would hate all of their guts
[4:25 PM] fancy: Does that make it wrong
[4:25 PM] fancy: Or bad
[4:25 PM] fancy: Or does it just make us different people
[4:25 PM] fancy: With different realms of interest
[4:25 PM] Suck it, Moto!: the latter
[4:25 PM] fancy: Aye
[4:25 PM] fancy: So don't hate on something because it's not your passion
[4:25 PM] fancy: And don't dismiss it because it's not your preference
[4:26 PM] fancy: Unless you think there's something morally wrong with loving games as a hobby
[4:26 PM] fancy: I could say the same things about partying
[4:26 PM] fancy: I could say partying isnt constructive
[4:26 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I prefaced this by saying it would be an unpopular opinion
[4:26 PM] fancy: And doesn't provide value
[4:26 PM] Suck it, Moto!: and here you are super salty
[4:26 PM] fancy: And etc
[4:26 PM] fancy: I'm not salty Andrew
[4:26 PM] Suck it, Moto!: You DO say those things
[4:27 PM] fancy: No
[4:27 PM] fancy: I said it doesn't provide value to me
[4:27 PM] fancy: And I've said
[4:27 PM] fancy: I don't understand it
[4:27 PM] fancy: And strictly speaking, yes, you can't put your party experience on a resume
[4:27 PM] fancy: Or your drinking
[4:27 PM] fancy: Or your drugs
[4:28 PM] fancy: Or your Frisbee golf hobby
[4:28 PM] fancy: But that's not the goal
[4:28 PM] fancy: The goal is to enjoy life
[4:28 PM] Subhanshu: Yeah i was just about to point that ou t
[4:29 PM] Suck it, Moto!: This is just one of those things where there is no way to get through to you
