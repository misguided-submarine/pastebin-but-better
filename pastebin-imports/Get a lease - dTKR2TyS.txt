10:47 PM] A Random Badger: Oh and you were right I think. Sara just kinda said the things she did to be like peacekeeper or some ig maybe. Cause they've spent a lot of time together and nothing has like been done all at the expense if yanno me basically so that's cool
[10:47 PM] A Random Badger: I need to get out of here
[10:47 PM] A Random Badger: Before like something bad happens
[10:47 PM] fancy: she's just like everyone who says things that they want to be or do, but never follow through cus they don't actually want to be those things
[10:47 PM] fancy: but they want to want those things
[10:47 PM] fancy: if that makes sense
[10:48 PM] A Random Badger: Yea ik
[10:48 PM] A Random Badger: Same way i was
[10:48 PM] A Random Badger: But she does this to us all the time
[10:48 PM] A Random Badger: She'll go get fucked by some dude at the expense of her friends w.o remorse
[10:49 PM] A Random Badger: This is the 2nd time and honestly the first was a bit understandable cause it was a 3 year relationship
[10:49 PM] A Random Badger: This guy ain't tying her down for shit. He ain't been here long at all
[10:49 PM] A Random Badger: She just doesn't care
[10:49 PM] A Random Badger: And I'm honestly just growing to despise her
[10:50 PM] A Random Badger: Which hurts me a lot
[10:50 PM] A Random Badger: Cause she was the first person who like got me on a good path
[10:50 PM] A Random Badger: But now it just causes me more hurt
[10:50 PM] A Random Badger: So fuck
[10:51 PM] A Random Badger: Wtf do I do
[10:51 PM] A Random Badger: Cause she even knows I'm on the suicidal edge again
[10:51 PM] A Random Badger: They thought I did it today cause I was home late
[10:51 PM] A Random Badger: And eventually like I prob will
[10:52 PM] A Random Badger: Or ill start a fucking fight
[10:52 PM] A Random Badger: Or who knows
[10:53 PM] A Random Badger: They even know I'm borderline starving myself and just sleeping the time away
[10:54 PM] A Random Badger: And I'm honestly gonna continue doing it cause fuck it
[10:54 PM] A Random Badger: Idgaf anymore
[10:55 PM] A Random Badger: Ill even leave my wallet outside the door cause the only time they'll need me is for my money anyways so fuck it
[11:05 PM] A Random Badger: I sleep till work tomorrow
September 24, 2018
[10:13 PM] A Random Badger: Weelllll
[10:13 PM] A Random Badger: I talked to sara some more
[10:13 PM] A Random Badger: And she hasn't talked to Justin about stuff yet
[10:16 PM] A Random Badger: And I basically told her that the only way its gonna work is if I keep doing what I'm doing which is working and then going straight to bed because even if we kicked him out he's still be here all the time cause they're dating and I'm obviously not gonna step into that mess and tell her they should break up but well I'm going to continue to suffer so they can be happy and shit and she basically brushed it off like w.e but idk what I would say either tho personally being the extremely passive person I am I'd probably just breakup with my girlfriend to make my friend happy but I can't expect or demand that of someone else
[10:17 PM] A Random Badger: This is tough
[10:17 PM] A Random Badger: I'm going through my uh fucking can't sleep stuff again
[10:17 PM] A Random Badger: W.e that's called
[10:17 PM] A Random Badger: Insomnia?
[10:17 PM] fancy: why can't you just
[10:17 PM] A Random Badger: That thing
[10:17 PM] fancy: ignore him
[10:17 PM] fancy: and not interact with him
[10:18 PM] fancy: and work toward something better
[10:18 PM] A Random Badger: This is basically me doing that
[10:18 PM] A Random Badger: But if I were to directly ignore him that would increase tension in the house which would make them both unhappy
[10:18 PM] fancy: sucks for them
[10:18 PM] fancy: too bad so sad
[10:18 PM] A Random Badger: And then who knows I get kicked out
[10:18 PM] A Random Badger: So
[10:18 PM] fancy: get on the lease
[10:19 PM] A Random Badger: Even still she's the landlords daughter there's no way I'm going to get a good binding lease allowing me to stay here when they decide they don't want me here
[10:20 PM] fancy: so
[10:20 PM] fancy: that's not how leases work
[10:20 PM] fancy: you can just like
[10:20 PM] fancy: have a bad lease
[10:20 PM] A Random Badger: Huh
[10:20 PM] A Random Badger: Explain
[10:21 PM] A Random Badger: Leases then ig
[10:21 PM] A Random Badger: The other thing tho is
[10:21 PM] A Random Badger: At least this way it brings me a little peace cause they get to be happy and I'm just that kind of idiot
[10:22 PM] fancy: like
[10:22 PM] fancy: you can't design a lease
[10:22 PM] fancy: that lets them kick you out
[10:22 PM] fancy: whenever
[10:22 PM] fancy: that's not a lease
[10:22 PM] fancy: lol
[10:31 PM] A Random Badger: No but can't he easily put some loop hole in along the lines of when renter causes other roommates discontent tenant has grounds to kick the renter out and if he wants something like that and I refuse can't he just refuse a lease and threaten to kick me out right there and then
[10:31 PM] A Random Badger: Idk
[10:31 PM] fancy: not really
[10:31 PM] fancy: that's not how that works
[10:33 PM] A Random Badger: Either way I get on the lease make everyone including myself miserable then what have I accomplished
[10:33 PM] A Random Badger: No matter what I kind lose until I'm out
[10:42 PM] A Random Badger: Idk
[11:06 PM] fancy: what
[11:06 PM] fancy: you have a place to live
[11:06 PM] fancy: that's what you accomplished
[11:06 PM] fancy: the other option is sleeping
