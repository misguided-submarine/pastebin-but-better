5:25 PM] fancy: you are doing the thing you think is funny but isn't really
[5:25 PM] fancy: srop
[5:27 PM] A Random Badger: Eh
[5:28 PM] A Random Badger: I always have used emojis a lot tho
[5:28 PM] A Random Badger: Idk why they're suddenly a problem
[5:28 PM] fancy: okay you're missing the point
[5:28 PM] fancy: You're acting really stupid and trying really hard to be funny
[5:28 PM] fancy: and every sentence contains an emoji lol
[5:28 PM] A Random Badger: That's what I do
[5:29 PM] A Random Badger: Lmao
[5:29 PM] fancy: it's annoying
[5:31 PM] A Random Badger: Idc lol I'm not interacting too much in that chat anyways
[5:32 PM] fancy: what the fuck lol
[5:32 PM] fancy: "someone is giving me valid feedback on my behaviours and my response will be to tell them I don't care and to fuck off"
[5:33 PM] fancy: how is that a rational response at all
[5:44 PM] A Random Badger: I'm sorry I'm not in good mindset today. I gotta go back to work. I will learn to control the things I say in your chat
[5:45 PM] fancy: I appreciate that
[5:45 PM] fancy: But it's not about where
[5:46 PM] fancy: it's just about acting intentionally dumb and trying to just say simple contrary things in an attempt at humour just doesn't come off well
[5:46 PM] fancy: I'm sure some people enjoy that kind of humour
[5:46 PM] fancy: but I don't
[5:46 PM] fancy: that's all
[5:46 PM] fancy: lol
[5:51 PM] A Random Badger: Well I can't bend to only appeal to you lol. Tbh most of things you guys do in that chat that are supposed to be humorous I also simply don't see the humor in. It's clearly just not a good match
[5:52 PM] fancy: Yeah but those things aren't conversations with you...
[5:53 PM] fancy: you were having a conversation with me
[5:53 PM] fancy: that's why I'm relevant
[5:53 PM] fancy: it doesn't matter if pizza finds it annoying
[5:53 PM] fancy: cus he wasn't involved
[5:54 PM] A Random Badger: Yea I know I'm just saying I'm very disconnected from that chat anyways
[5:55 PM] fancy: why do u refer to the chat as an entity in itself
[5:55 PM] fancy: I don't understand
[5:56 PM] fancy: the conversations I have with Yoshi no one else finds interesting
[5:56 PM] fancy: the conversations Nikki has with me
[5:56 PM] fancy: no one else likes
[5:56 PM] fancy: like
[5:56 PM] fancy: it's not like a thing
[5:56 PM] fancy: it's just a space
[5:56 PM] fancy: it's like if u went to the common area in a dorm or something
[5:56 PM] fancy: and said that the space doesn't fit with u
[5:56 PM] fancy: it's just a place to have conversations lol
5:58 PM] A Random Badger: Okay
[6:04 PM] A Random Badger: Even still there doesn't seem to be anything that connects me with anyone else in there in terms of relevance. I'm disconnected from all if you, if that makes more sense. None of us are really interested in the same things anymore and I just tried to include myself a little bit by posting those videos which have apparently gotten absolute 0 interest anyways so I thought at least being cringy would include me a little bit but apparently not as well. So that'd what I mean by that I'm very disconnected from that chat, as in the people within it.
[6:05 PM] A Random Badger: Idk what else to do lol
[6:07 PM] A Random Badger: And I haven't been too keen on joining for Mhw with you and Nikki since I found out Blairin was playing it with her and I absolutely refuse to get involved with him because if I do there'll be virtual bloodshed and a lot of outward hatred because I'm not gonna tolerate the least bit of his idiocy.
[6:07 PM] A Random Badger: And I heard you've recently even compromised to play with him and Nikki and yea I'm just not about that
[6:10 PM] fancy: he's not as bad as he used to be
[6:10 PM] fancy: he's moderate levels of obnoxious
[6:12 PM] fancy: I don't like puppets
[6:12 PM] fancy: and I've said this
[6:12 PM] A Random Badger: I would still turn the place into a warzone the second he tried any of his shit
[6:12 PM] fancy: idk what other ppl think
[6:13 PM] A Random Badger: And that wouldn't be fun for anyone
[6:13 PM] fancy: but it's not like Nikki gets a response to yebin
[6:13 PM] fancy: or me for kpop
[6:14 PM] fancy: also don't you only have second hand experience
[6:14 PM] A Random Badger: Yea that's fine but you guys all have dota and shit to talk about at least. That's why I'm disappointed
[6:14 PM] A Random Badger: With what
[6:14 PM] A Random Badger: Blairin?
[6:14 PM] fancy: with blairin
[6:14 PM] fancy: yeah
[6:14 PM] A Random Badger: No
[6:14 PM] fancy: like what do you mean "starts shit"
[6:14 PM] fancy: lol
[6:14 PM] fancy: he doesn't start shit he's just obnoxious
[6:15 PM] A Random Badger: Like as soon as he tried to say something toxic or act superior or smart like hes the best thing since sliced bread
[6:16 PM] A Random Badger: I'd turn the motherfucker into sliced bread
[6:16 PM] fancy: that's kinda hypocritical I think
[6:16 PM] A Random Badger: Sure but its special treatment for him because I despise him
[6:17 PM] A Random Badger: I just don't tolerate people like him once I've dealt with them the first couple times
[6:17 PM] A Random Badger: Like royal
[6:17 PM] A Random Badger: I'm very critical of those kinds of people once I see what they're all about
[6:18 PM] A Random Badger: Even if they improve
[6:18 PM] A Random Badger: But maybe that's just my uh
[6:18 PM] A Random Badger: How did you put it a long time ago
[6:18 PM] A Random Badger: Justice complex or smth
[6:18 PM] A Random Badger: You said smth like that
[6:19 PM] A Random Badger: About me
[6:19 PM] A Random Badger: But yea I just don't tolerate people like him and royal and emotion and etc after a point
[6:21 PM] fancy: That's pretty immature
[6:21 PM] fancy: and like I said, hypocritical
6:24 PM] A Random Badger: Sure but its just engraved into my being at this point and I personally see no problem with myself being that way. I do not tolerate people who put down others and act like they're the top of the food chain. I live to ruin those kinds of people figuratively speaking. Like when I flipped tf out on royal in taw.
[6:24 PM] A Random Badger: So I refuse to interact with them.
[6:25 PM] fancy: People change
[6:25 PM] fancy: Under your philosophy you would write off every person
[6:25 PM] fancy: because every single person is like that when they're a teenager
[6:25 PM] fancy: Including you
[6:25 PM] A Random Badger: I have written off many people that way
[6:26 PM] fancy: To be consistent you would have to write off everyone.
[6:26 PM] fancy: Otherwise you're selectively applying this
[6:27 PM] A Random Badger: I do not believe in that generalization you put forward tho
[6:27 PM] A Random Badger: I'm also very skeptical to believing in people change as well
[6:27 PM] fancy: You're contesting that everyone acts like they know everything when they're teenagers?
[6:27 PM] fancy: Because that's pretty universally acknowledged
[6:28 PM] A Random Badger: Oh no but do all teenagers use that as a reason to put down others and be toxic?
[6:28 PM] fancy: yes
[6:28 PM] fancy: every teenager
[6:28 PM] A Random Badger: I disagree
[6:28 PM] fancy: is toxic as fuck
[6:28 PM] fancy: teenagers are the WORST humans
[6:29 PM] A Random Badger: Was blairin a teenager?
[6:29 PM] fancy: everyone was a teenager
[6:29 PM] fancy: what do you mean
[6:30 PM] A Random Badger: No when he was being the way he was before you claim he changed
[6:30 PM] fancy: probably
[6:30 PM] fancy: pretty sure he's not like 30
[6:31 PM] A Random Badger: Uh okay
[6:32 PM] A Random Badger: I'm still not convinced by either of your points. I do not believe people change and I do not believe every teenager is a bully
[6:32 PM] fancy: they may not bully but they're toxic in other ways
[6:32 PM] fancy: picking one arbitrarily to crucify is asinine
[6:32 PM] fancy: and people do change
[6:32 PM] fancy: doesn't matter if you believe it or not
[6:32 PM] fancy: I didn't
[6:33 PM] A Random Badger: I certainly do not from my own experience.
[6:34 PM] fancy: what experience
[6:34 PM] fancy: lol
[6:34 PM] fancy: in the grand scheme of things what weighs more
[6:34 PM] fancy: your personal experience
[6:34 PM] fancy: or everyone else
[6:34 PM] fancy: that tells you how they didn't think people changed and then they realized they were wrong
[6:35 PM] fancy: there's a reason they write stories and shows and etc about that message
[6:35 PM] A Random Badger: And I think those people are deluded
[6:36 PM] fancy: And you're wrong and you'll figure that out one day
[6:36 PM] A Random Badger: I think they only believe it because they either want to or because some idiot pretended to be changed
[6:36 PM] fancy: People change badger
[6:36 PM] fancy: ask anyone if I'm the same person I was two years ago
[6:37 PM] fancy: ask Nikki if she's the same person she was in high school
[6:37 PM] fancy: 55 year olds probably don't change
[6:37 PM] fancy: 20 year olds can be different people every year
[6:38 PM] A Random Badger: What about you substantially changed in 2 years
[6:39 PM] A Random Badger: I changed in a way over my past
6:39 PM] fancy: oh man
[6:40 PM] A Random Badger: But the core of me is still very much the same
[6:40 PM] fancy: pizza describes it better than I can
[6:40 PM] fancy: okay sure but I hardly think you're in a position to judge what other people are at their core
[6:40 PM] fancy: How similar to you do you think I am now
[6:41 PM] A Random Badger: The only semi substantial change I encounter was I began to develop some mesogonistic(can't figure out how to spell word) characteristics especially as of late
[6:42 PM] A Random Badger: You are now to what?
[6:42 PM] fancy: to you
[6:42 PM] A Random Badger: You are the same person I met
[6:42 PM] fancy: okay maybe longer than two years srry
[6:42 PM] fancy: I'm bad at the passage of time
[6:42 PM] A Random Badger: Same
[6:42 PM] fancy: even in the past two years
[6:42 PM] fancy: I've changed
[6:42 PM] A Random Badger: In what ways tho
[6:42 PM] fancy: I'm way more patient
[6:43 PM] fancy: I have learned a lot more things
[6:43 PM] fancy: about life
[6:43 PM] fancy: I have more perspective
[6:43 PM] A Random Badger: I think there is a difference between growing and changing.
[6:43 PM] A Random Badger: A maple tree can grow and become better every year but it can never become and oak
[6:44 PM] fancy: I didn't become a spider
[6:44 PM] A Random Badger: An*
[6:44 PM] fancy: I'm still a human
[6:44 PM] A Random Badger: But what at your core changed
[6:44 PM] fancy: in the last two years?
[6:44 PM] A Random Badger: Ever
[6:44 PM] fancy: What do you define as core
[6:47 PM] A Random Badger: While blairin may have grown to become more in control of his toxic and abusive tendancies I doubt he has rid himself of them all together. I believe he still thinks the same way and as a result influences his actions based on those thoughts, just in a more deceptive way. But if you put the wolf in a contained location where it thinks no one is watching do you think it will not attempt to kill the prey that has been released into its cage? Do you think blairin would not treat people he does not know the same way he "used to" when others are not around?
[6:48 PM] A Random Badger: You cant train a beast to never bite
[6:48 PM] fancy: What qualifies you to determine what someone's core is
[6:48 PM] fancy: what's my core
[6:48 PM] fancy: answer that
[6:55 PM] A Random Badger: I do not believe you have presented it available. People who have the intent to actually trust and become friends with people are more careful to expose themselves because they don't want to ruin that relationship. Meanwhile people who don't intend on making friends or putting trust into others aren't concerned about exposing themselves as much and will let loose their behaviors more freely.
[6:56 PM] fancy: That's
[6:56 PM] fancy: just not true at all
[6:56 PM] fancy: lol
[6:56 PM] fancy: at this point in my life, I'm way more open than anyone you've met, I'm willing to bet money on this
[6:56 PM] fancy: I don't have fear of ruining relationships lol what are you talking about
[6:56 PM] fancy: you have that backwards
[6:57 PM] fancy: people who don't care don't reveal who they really are, as a general principle(edited)
[6:57 PM] fancy: people who do care are often scared to show who they are
[6:57 PM] fancy: but that doesn't mean it's hidden
[6:58 PM] fancy: and then there's always the vice versa
[6:58 PM] fancy: and then also, everyone wants friends
[6:58 PM] fancy: no one wants to be disliked by everyone
[6:59 PM] fancy: If you can't figure out whatever you think my "core" is, and you've interacted with me 200x more than with blairin
[6:59 PM] fancy: what makes you so sure you have blairin pinned down
[7:01 PM] fancy: it feels like you're taking the most convenient reason that justifies your desire
[7:01 PM] fancy: which is to have him be someone to hate and crucify
7:01 PM] fancy: even if it may not make sense to do that
[7:08 PM] A Random Badger: And even if people could change how has blairin changed? How did he go from a toxic sludgepool of a human to something even close to decent. And what convinced you so easily that he has?
[7:09 PM] A Random Badger: 2 weeks ago you hated him just as much as I did
[7:09 PM] A Random Badger: Was it not simply a compromise for Nikki's sake?
[7:10 PM] fancy: I never hated him as much as you do lol
[7:10 PM] A Random Badger: You thought he was a garbage human you didn't want to interact with
[7:10 PM] fancy: you dodged my question
[7:10 PM] fancy: and yeah then I had a positive interaction with him
[7:11 PM] fancy: I think most people act like garbage
[7:11 PM] fancy: I exaggerate a lot badger u know this
[7:11 PM] A Random Badger: What good does one positive interaction do?
[7:12 PM] fancy: A lot if you don't have underlying motive of wanting to hate people
[7:12 PM] fancy: also still dodging my question
[7:12 PM] fancy: you have to answer this one
[7:12 PM] fancy: otherwise everything you're trying to hold falls apart
[7:13 PM] A Random Badger: Which
[7:13 PM] A Random Badger: How I pinned blairin down?
[7:15 PM] fancy: how can you say you've figured out blairins core and you can't even guess at mine
[7:15 PM] A Random Badger: It doesn't take a lot of effort to be a decent person. Some people just refuse to be decent and I think he's the same. I think he simply has refused to be a decent person and I think that says a lot about someone.
[7:16 PM] A Random Badger: Meanwhile you actively make yourself a decent person as much as possible
[7:18 PM] fancy: I'm more critical than blairin
[7:18 PM] fancy: at my "core"
[7:18 PM] fancy: if you want to call it that
[7:21 PM] fancy: This is my point about how can you possibly think you know what someone is about
[7:33 PM] A Random Badger: Because while I don't have a large sample size of his behavior and mannerism his first impressions were terrible and considering people always try to make themselves look their best during first impressions, if they still make themselves look like garbage humans its either because they're garbage humans at their best or they just don't care to be decent, and if someone can't care to be decent towards or around others even for a first impression then it exposes how bad that person is
[7:34 PM] fancy: That's not true
[7:35 PM] fancy: People only try to have good first impressions on people they care about impressing
[7:35 PM] fancy: also time has passed and people change
[7:36 PM] fancy: and some combination of him becoming more tolerable and me becoming more mature and patient
[7:36 PM] fancy: makes something work that didn't before
[7:36 PM] A Random Badger: But if he can't be anywhere near decent for the first and following times? And I still don't believe people change but if so what about him changed that makes him more pleasant?
[7:36 PM] fancy: but basically you said that you figured him out because you think you did
[7:36 PM] fancy: he's less unpleasant
[7:36 PM] fancy: what do you mean
[7:37 PM] fancy: you're overcomplicating it again
[7:37 PM] A Random Badger: Well then he didn't change
[7:37 PM] fancy: ????
[7:37 PM] A Random Badger: He only grew to be more tolerable
7:37 PM] fancy: you're using some very strange definition of change
[7:37 PM] A Random Badger: That doesn't mean he's different
[7:37 PM] A Random Badger: He's still the same
[7:37 PM] fancy: not really
[7:38 PM] fancy: your definition of change is like
[7:38 PM] fancy: trauma
[7:38 PM] fancy: lol
[7:38 PM] A Random Badger: Well w.e I don't have time to continue this. Even if he changed and is less unpleasant, that's certainly not enough for me to consider doing shit with him
[7:38 PM] fancy: that wasn't the point lol
[7:39 PM] A Random Badger: What was then
[7:39 PM] fancy: how you apply your standards selectively
[7:39 PM] fancy: my point is that everyone is like blairin at one point or another in their lives
[7:41 PM] fancy: so if you want to really stick to your standard you'd have to write everyone off
[7:41 PM] fancy: or admit that you just have decided to not like him and you don't ever want to revisit it
[7:41 PM] fancy: and it really has little to do with him
[7:42 PM] fancy: because you feel like you've figured him out for now and ever
[7:42 PM] A Random Badger: And I still disagree that everyone has been like blairin unless blairin was not as bad as I thought he was and I'm heavily deluding who he was or even confusing him for someone else entirely
[7:43 PM] fancy: based on what
[7:43 PM] fancy: everyone goes through the phase of thinking they know better than everyone else
[7:43 PM] A Random Badger: But not everyone uses that to blatantly attack others
[7:44 PM] fancy: 6 of one, half dozen of the other
[7:45 PM] fancy: toxic is toxic
[7:45 PM] fancy: no matter how it manifests
[7:51 PM] A Random Badger: Fine then but I still refuse to interact with him because if he did something toxic I would blow up on him immediately in from of both of you and it wouldn't be fun for anyone
[7:52 PM] fancy: and I'm calling that hypocritical and immature
[7:54 PM] A Random Badger: Why is it hypocritical?
[7:55 PM] fancy: because you're being super uncharitable toward him and very charitable toward yourself and people you have decided to like
[7:56 PM] A Random Badger: But I'm not gonna treat someone decent who wouldn't treat me or others the same way
[7:59 PM] fancy: Hypocritical
[8:03 PM] A Random Badger: So I should suck it up and tolerate him just to play with you and Nikki lol
[8:57 PM] fancy: no
[8:57 PM] fancy: again(edited)
[8:57 PM] fancy: not the point
[8:58 PM] fancy: it's not an instance of being right or wrong
[8:58 PM] fancy: its an opportunity to reflect
[8:59 PM] fancy: and think about whether your reaction and thoughts and feelings make sense or not
[9:39 PM] A Random Badger: i mean i know its immature and hypocritical
[9:39 PM] A Random Badger: so im just gonna
[9:39 PM] A Random Badger: not put myself in that situation
[9:39 PM] A Random Badger: lol
[9:39 PM] fancy: That's
[9:39 PM] fancy: a very
[9:39 PM] fancy: disappointing solution
[9:39 PM] fancy: lol
[9:41 PM] A Random Badger: i mean i just dont want to deal with him, because while you may now have the patience to tolerate him, i certainly dont, and i know if me and him get into the slightest disagreement nikki is gonna be all up for defending him and im not gonna get in an argument with her about how she's dumb for defending an asshole with her "its not serious" meme
[9:41 PM] fancy: there's a lot of issues with that paragraph
[9:42 PM] fancy: you're getting caught up in details still
9:42 PM] A Random Badger: but i dont wanna put is in that situation and then have it be not enjoyable for any of us
[9:42 PM] fancy: n o t t h e p o i n t
[9:42 PM] A Random Badger: because im absolutely certain that if me and blairin did get into it thats exactly what would happen
[9:43 PM] fancy: yes and you'd blame him
[9:43 PM] fancy: and he'd blame u
[9:43 PM] fancy: cus ur both dum
[9:43 PM] A Random Badger: what im more worried about
[9:43 PM] A Random Badger: is when nikki defends him
[9:43 PM] A Random Badger: and i have to call her dumb and hurt her feelings because she's dumb
[9:43 PM] fancy: shes not dumb lol
[9:44 PM] fancy: saying "he's toxic just ignore it" is a valid argument
[9:44 PM] A Random Badger: i dont mean overall
[9:44 PM] A Random Badger: no
[9:44 PM] A Random Badger: i dont think it is
[9:44 PM] A Random Badger: i think its real dumb
[9:44 PM] fancy: Nikki 100% doesn't care what you think of her
[9:44 PM] A Random Badger: if someone is toxic
[9:44 PM] A Random Badger: you dont ignore
[9:44 PM] fancy: I mean you also think people don't change
[9:44 PM] fancy: so
[9:44 PM] A Random Badger: you get rid of the trash
[9:44 PM] A Random Badger: simple
[9:44 PM] fancy: everyone is toxic
[9:44 PM] fancy: you're toxic
[9:44 PM] fancy: Nikki is toxic
[9:45 PM] fancy: Yoshi is toxic
[9:45 PM] fancy: everyone has toxic parts
[9:45 PM] fancy: so once again, either apply your standards equally or don't pretend you have them
[9:45 PM] A Random Badger: ugh i know but i think a toxic trait that revolves around hurting others is 100% objectively worse than any other toxic trait
[9:45 PM] A Random Badger: and if he started htat shit
[9:45 PM] A Random Badger: i wouldnt deal with
[9:46 PM] fancy: Yoshi enjoys upsetting people
[9:46 PM] A Random Badger: whether it was towards me or you or her
[9:46 PM] fancy: how is that not the same
[9:46 PM] fancy: you enjoy upsetting me apparently
[9:46 PM] fancy: you can only be as bothered by shit as you decide to be
[9:46 PM] A Random Badger: i also think yoshi is an ass for that and i dont really care for him that much tbh lmao
[9:46 PM] fancy: okay so are we supposed to apply that to you too
[9:47 PM] A Random Badger: thats up to you lol
[9:47 PM] A Random Badger: but for me
[9:47 PM] A Random Badger: i dont deal with it
[9:47 PM] fancy: I think this is just gonna come down to me telling you that
[9:47 PM] fancy: this justice complex is
[9:47 PM] fancy: not going to work out for you in the long run
[9:47 PM] fancy: people aren't pure
[9:47 PM] fancy: they have bad and good
[9:48 PM] fancy: that's just life
[9:48 PM] fancy: you cant write everyone off cus they have bad parts(edited)
[9:48 PM] A Random Badger: i dont write people off because of bad parts, i write them off based off how they handle themselves and how they balance their traits
[9:49 PM] A Random Badger: someone who intentionally gives way to the bad traits
[9:49 PM] A Random Badger: yea
[9:49 PM] A Random Badger: fuck them
[9:49 PM] fancy: you say this and it's not true
[9:49 PM] A Random Badger: lmao
[9:49 PM] fancy: because "intentionally gives way to bad traits" is a meaningless statement
[9:50 PM] fancy: once again, you're psychoanalyzing ppl without the proper qualifications
[9:50 PM] fancy: you judge other ppl by what they do and yourself by what you intend
[9:51 PM] fancy: like you have all these standards for other ppl that you don't adhere to yourself
[9:53 PM] A Random Badger: yea i guess you're right
[9:54 PM] fancy: it doesn't hurt to be a little charitable
[9:54 PM] A Random Badger: yea ig
