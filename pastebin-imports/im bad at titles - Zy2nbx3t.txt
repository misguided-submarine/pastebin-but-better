[1:03 AM] A Random Badger: like i said
[1:03 AM] fancy: except here you are asking about it
[1:03 AM] fancy: lol
[1:03 AM] A Random Badger: tyler is just being sneaky
[1:03 AM] A Random Badger: and dumb
[1:03 AM] A Random Badger: or
[1:03 AM] A Random Badger: if nikki is huge bitch
[1:03 AM] fancy: she's a woman, isn't your default that she's a bitch
[1:04 AM] A Random Badger: and if nikki is huge bitch then i care slightly more cause then i feel in a way like im validated xd
[1:04 AM] fancy: you're not validated I'll just tell you that lol
[1:05 AM] A Random Badger: well i am in the sense that, im right about her not just being this perfect little princess i feel like you portray her as if she is just a huge bitch towards tyler for no reason other than she's toxic scum
[1:05 AM] fancy: I dont think I've ever said she's a perfect princess lol wtf
[1:05 AM] A Random Badger: my words not yours lol
[1:06 AM] A Random Badger: thats just how i feel like you portray her
[1:06 AM] A Random Badger: as this being that can't do any wrong
[1:06 AM] A Random Badger: personally
[1:06 AM] fancy: I mean I take no responsibility for your interpretation of reality
[1:07 AM] A Random Badger: so anyways do you know about any of this? like is this just a load of bs from tyler? xd
[1:07 AM] A Random Badger: cause i also dont care for tyler
[1:07 AM] A Random Badger: so idc which outcome it is
[1:07 AM] A Random Badger: tbh
[1:07 AM] fancy: almost everything that comes out of Tyler is motivated by perhaps a real feeling and then coloured by a large amount of personal bias and general teenaged bullshit
[1:07 AM] fancy: with a good dose of not being very smart thrown in
[1:08 AM] fancy: he broke a promise
[1:08 AM] fancy: and I trust nikki's judgment
[1:09 AM] A Random Badger: im guessing you just asked her rq lol
[1:09 AM] A Random Badger: i see tho
[1:09 AM] fancy: why would you think that lol
[1:09 AM] A Random Badger: based on what seemed like a break in thought
[1:09 AM] fancy: there's no break in thought there
[1:10 AM] A Random Badger: the line "he broke a promise" seemed sudden
[1:10 AM] fancy: you asked if it's a load of bullshit
[1:10 AM] fancy: I said most of what he says is bullshit that got twisted from reality
[1:10 AM] A Random Badger: yes lol
[1:10 AM] fancy: she told me he broke a promise to her and I trust her
[1:10 AM] fancy: that's what I know
[1:10 AM] A Random Badger: okay gotcha
[1:10 AM] fancy: he does this to himself and plays victim
[1:10 AM] fancy: it happens over and over
[1:11 AM] A Random Badger: oh so this happens frequently?
[1:11 AM] fancy: the pattern of playing victim?
[1:11 AM] fancy: yeah he's a teenager
[1:11 AM] fancy: he's dumb like the rest
[1:12 AM] A Random Badger: no i meant these kinds of altercations
[1:12 AM] A Random Badger: but yea i gotcha
[1:12 AM] A Random Badger: that makes sense tho reading through this
[1:12 AM] A Random Badger: that he broke a promise
1:12 AM] fancy: he and Nikki fight a lot, I don't know why she put up with him, but I trust her to make her own choices
[1:12 AM] A Random Badger: aren't they dating or smth
[1:13 AM] fancy: but he always plays victim and never takes personal responsibility for anything as far as I can tell
[1:13 AM] fancy: so history repeats itself
[1:13 AM] fancy: that's not a question I can answer I don't think
[1:13 AM] A Random Badger: well i mean i think i know the answer cause apparently tyler told pizza they are dating
[1:13 AM] A Random Badger: but idk if thats also
[1:13 AM] A Random Badger: bs from tyler
[1:13 AM] A Random Badger: lol
[1:14 AM] A Random Badger: but this definitely sounds like
[1:14 AM] A Random Badger: classic mad gf
[1:14 AM] A Random Badger: reaction to breaking a promise
[1:14 AM] A Random Badger: so it all makes sense to me now i think
[1:14 AM] fancy: sounds like classic normal human being reaction to breaking a promise
[1:14 AM] A Random Badger: especially if he constantly does this stuff
[1:14 AM] A Random Badger: well idk if the classic normal human reaction is
[1:15 AM] fancy: to be angry?
[1:15 AM] A Random Badger: quite as aggressive
[1:15 AM] A Random Badger: depending on the promise
[1:15 AM] fancy: your reaction to animals being animals is to want to kill them
[1:15 AM] fancy: soooo
[1:15 AM] A Random Badger: but definitely this aggressive if it's repeated behavior
[1:15 AM] A Random Badger: wat
[1:15 AM] A Random Badger: no thats you
[1:15 AM] A Random Badger: with my chickens
[1:15 AM] A Random Badger: rude man
[1:16 AM] A Random Badger: you're the one who just wants to kill and eat all the animals
[1:16 AM] A Random Badger: xd
[1:16 AM] A Random Badger: but yea idk what the promise was
[1:16 AM] A Random Badger: so
[1:16 AM] A Random Badger: but thinking back to the time when
[1:16 AM] A Random Badger: you got betrayed by hope and that whole group
[1:16 AM] A Random Badger: when you got treated like shit
[1:16 AM] A Random Badger: even you didnt react so aggressively
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: so thats where im making the comparison
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: but also
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: as i said
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: if this is repeated behavior from him
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: then that is definitely the type of reaction i would expect
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: is what im saying
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: lol
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: but okay
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: i see now
[1:17 AM] A Random Badger: my curiosity
[1:18 AM] A Random Badger: has been satiated
[1:18 AM] A Random Badger: ty
[1:18 AM] fancy: no you wanted to kill a dog but instead you punched a fence
[1:18 AM] fancy: i don't want to eat animals out of anger
[1:18 AM] fancy: I want to eat them because they are delicious
[1:18 AM] A Random Badger: oh you're tlaking about that
[1:18 AM] fancy: I didn't react aggressively because I wasn't mad I was broken
[1:19 AM] A Random Badger: well tbf, it was someone else's dog who had no control over it that did damage to our property and killed some of our animals
[1:19 AM] A Random Badger: so yea i wanted to kill it
1:19 AM] A Random Badger: lol
[1:19 AM] fancy: you're just rationalizing it now
[1:19 AM] fancy: lol
[1:19 AM] fancy: I'm just pointing out
[1:19 AM] fancy: you had a more aggressive reaction to anger
[1:19 AM] A Random Badger: yea i get it now
[1:19 AM] A Random Badger: but anyways
[1:19 AM] fancy: everyone is different
[1:19 AM] A Random Badger: ty for satiating my curiosity
[1:19 AM] A Random Badger: lol
[1:20 AM] fancy: I'm more frequently aggressive but less extreme
[1:22 AM] fancy: but yeah
[1:22 AM] fancy: I also only know mostly nikki's side
[1:22 AM] fancy: and I try not to pry
[1:22 AM] fancy: so
[1:22 AM] A Random Badger: well
[1:23 AM] A Random Badger: i got some of both sides
[1:23 AM] A Random Badger: and nikki's definitely seems reasonable
[1:23 AM] A Random Badger: essentially all i know about tyler's side is
[1:23 AM] fancy: tyler is a piece of work that's all I will say
[1:23 AM] fancy: imo
[1:23 AM] fancy: he has a lot of growing up to do
[1:23 AM] A Random Badger: he decided to play scp or smth with another group of friends for an hour
[1:23 AM] A Random Badger: and she just got mad for no reason
[1:23 AM] fancy: I think he has issues with cause and effect
[1:23 AM] fancy: idk
[1:23 AM] A Random Badger: idk
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: but i think
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: nikki's side
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: pairs well with the given messages
[1:24 AM] fancy: nikki is pretty predictable
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: pretty well
[1:24 AM] fancy: at least as far as I have seen
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: so i definitely buy into that more than tyler's
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: cause its definitely clear that like
[1:24 AM] fancy: tyler makes excuses and rationalizations and never owns anything
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: she was angry he broke a promise
[1:24 AM] fancy: he has never apologized to me
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: and then he played dumb and victim
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: which made her mroe angry
[1:24 AM] fancy: for many things he's don eot me
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: ofc
[1:24 AM] A Random Badger: so yea
[1:25 AM] A Random Badger: yea i mean
[1:25 AM] A Random Badger: all i know
[1:25 AM] A Random Badger: is from his behavior on his dumb stream
[1:25 AM] A Random Badger: which is
[1:25 AM] A Random Badger: quite shit
[1:25 AM] A Random Badger: imo
[1:25 AM] A Random Badger: lmao
[1:27 AM] fancy: not a very smart individual
[1:27 AM] A Random Badger: yes lmao
[1:27 AM] A Random Badger: anyways
[1:27 AM] A Random Badger: bed time for me
[1:27 AM] fancy: yes
[1:27 AM] fancy: have fun
[1:27 AM] fancy: I am in pain
[1:27 AM] fancy: and dying
[1:27 AM] fancy: woo
[1:27 AM] A Random Badger: ty for indulging me
[1:27 AM] A Random Badger: i would've messages nikki myself probably
[1:27 AM] A Random Badger: but i have her blocked
[1:27 AM] A Random Badger: so
[1:27 AM] A Random Badger: lmao
[1:28 AM] fancy: you dumbass.
[1:28 AM] A Random Badger: well she initially blocked me anyways during our "altercation"
[1:28 AM] A Random Badger: and since she doesnt want to talk to me anymore anyways
[1:28 AM] A Random Badger: its w.e to me
[1:28 AM] A Random Badger: so i blocked her as well
[1:29 AM] fancy: if only there was a way to repair bridges instead of just burning them
[1:29 AM] fancy: wouldn't that be neat
[1:29 AM] A Random Badger: well sure, but idc enough, cause i still have a fairly strong feeling against nikki, and we already went into that in detail
[1:30 AM] A Random Badger: no point reiterating
[1:30 AM] A Random Badger: and i dont see a point repairing that bridge either
[1:30 AM] A Random Badger: cause i dont gain anything from it
1:30 AM] fancy: and u couldn't POSSIBLY be wrong
[1:30 AM] fancy: xd
[1:32 AM] A Random Badger: well i disagree, like i exclaimed before, i still think her not really helping to communicate and just dming you instead was still part of the issue and the fact that she wouldn't even allow me to dig into it so i could try to mend everything so we could still play tabletop as the person who planned on taking over control since no one else wanted to is a big oof from me
[1:34 AM] fancy: you didn't like my answer before you won't like it now
[1:35 AM] fancy: you don't accept the tried and true method of working on the major issue before the minor issues
[1:35 AM] fancy: or the ideology of being diplomatic
[1:35 AM] fancy: so
[1:35 AM] fancy: not much I can do to convicne you of their usefulness
[1:35 AM] fancy: you'll just have to live more and experience more things
[1:44 AM] A Random Badger: well as i tried explaining last time, this was before even i knew she was at least messaging you, and i my mind she was just as guilty as everyone else so she was part of the overlying major issue, so ofc i was gonna lecture her as well
[1:44 AM] A Random Badger: it wasn't until after all was said and done that we got into our conversation
[1:44 AM] A Random Badger: which had it happened sooner, i may have spoken to nikki differently
[1:45 AM] A Random Badger: especially with the knowledge that she at least was messaging you
[1:45 AM] A Random Badger: then i only would've been like hey yanno, im trying to get everyone to communicate, and you only messaging fancy doesnt really help towards that goal
[1:45 AM] A Random Badger: and it would've been a lot better
[1:46 AM] A Random Badger: but that opportunity wasn't available at the moment, when i was under the only presumption that she was just as guilty as everyone else
[1:46 AM] A Random Badger: so ofc i was going to treat and question her
[1:46 AM] A Random Badger: as everyone else
[1:47 AM] A Random Badger: and ofc i turned up the heat with my aggressiveness when she insisted on not just letting me talk to her about the situation and just wanted to be a vague and a bitch for asking her questions
[1:47 AM] A Random Badger: and the fact that she got offended
[1:47 AM] A Random Badger: is a big her problem
[1:47 AM] fancy: LOL
[1:47 AM] fancy: ok
[1:47 AM] fancy: good luck with that
[1:49 AM] A Random Badger: well she was never my friend to begin with so idc lmao
[1:49 AM] A Random Badger: i suffered no loss as far as i can tell imo
[1:50 AM] fancy: no one will be if you give them baggage before you meet them
[1:50 AM] A Random Badger: wym baggage
[1:50 AM] fancy: you like to read way into people
[1:50 AM] fancy: when you don't know much
[1:51 AM] A Random Badger: i knew all i needed to know for the given situation lol
[1:51 AM] fancy: that's
[1:51 AM] fancy: really arrogant
[1:51 AM] fancy: lol
[1:51 AM] A Random Badger: well
[1:51 AM] A Random Badger: i knew there was an issue with communication
[1:51 AM] fancy: and so clearly the response is to get as angry as I was
[1:51 AM] fancy: lol
[1:51 AM] A Random Badger: i knew, at the time, that everyone including nikki was part of that problem
[1:51 AM] fancy: no
[1:51 AM] fancy: you thought you knew
[1:52 AM] fancy: you didn't have all the information
[1:52 AM] fancy: you were wrong
[1:52 AM] fancy: simple
[1:52 AM] A Random Badger: well that was information you neglected to feed me when i told you i was going to talk to everyone about the issue, because it was only information that you knew, so ofc i had to go in with what knowledge i had
[1:53 AM] A Random Badger: which meant that nikki was included in part of the problem
[1:53 AM] fancy: I didn't give you informatino about anyone
[1:53 AM] fancy: but you assumed I gave you everything
[1:53 AM] fancy: you didn't even ask about people specifically
[1:53 AM] fancy: you just
[1:53 AM] fancy: started acting
[1:53 AM] A Random Badger: i believe i specifically talked to you about what i was planning on doing for quite a bit before i actually acted
[1:54 AM] A Random Badger: because i also said that i was thinking about
[1:54 AM] A Random Badger: just bringing it up publicly in discord
[1:54 AM] A Random Badger: before i mentioned just talking to everyone individually
[1:54 AM] A Random Badger: you told me what the issue was
[1:54 AM] A Random Badger: and that you were done doing what you were doing
[1:54 AM] A Random Badger: i told you i owuld step up
[1:55 AM] A Random Badger: and that i would talk to everyone who was part of the issue
[1:55 AM] A Random Badger: with the given information
[1:55 AM] A Random Badger: i have no other conclusion to come to
[1:55 AM] A Random Badger: other than
[1:55 AM] A Random Badger: nikki was part of the issue
[1:55 AM] A Random Badger: just as much as yoshi and julian and pizza
[1:56 AM] A Random Badger: but you never took the opportunity to say
[1:56 AM] fancy: https://puu.sh/DfSKp/d1853cc08f.png

[1:56 AM] fancy: you didn't even show me what you were gonna say
[1:56 AM] A Random Badger: "well at least nikki messaged me and told me what to do"
[1:56 AM] fancy: and you were definitely still aggressive
[1:56 AM] A Random Badger: my intial message was a lot more aggressive
[1:56 AM] A Random Badger: and i did send it to you
[1:56 AM] fancy: yikes
[1:56 AM] A Random Badger: but i changed my mind
[1:56 AM] A Random Badger: and deleted it
[1:57 AM] A Random Badger: and decided it was best to message people individually
[1:57 AM] A Random Badger: and just question them on their opinions and feeligns about the situation
[1:57 AM] A Random Badger: and i actually wasn't aggressive with anyone else
[1:58 AM] A Random Badger: and the only reason i was remotely aggressive with nikki was because of the way she curved me when i tried talking to her and gave me a completely vague answer about wanting to continue playing
[1:58 AM] A Random Badger: and then not wanting to elaborate when i asked about what she meant
[1:58 AM] A Random Badger: there was nothing remotely aggressive in any of my messages to anyone up to that point
[1:59 AM] A Random Badger: and that was when i started getting messages from you
[1:59 AM] A Random Badger: because she cried to you cause i offended her
[2:00 AM] A Random Badger: which again, is a big her problem
[2:01 AM] A Random Badger: because nothing aggressive or offending would've been said or taken if she would've just spoke to me about the situation
[2:01 AM] A Random Badger: so i could come to a conclusion on how to handle it
[2:02 AM] A Random Badger: but yes im the sole guilty party in this situation because i was "mean" to someone who refused to just fucking talk to me
[2:02 AM] A Random Badger: i bed now
[2:02 AM] A Random Badger: ty for coming to part 2 of my ted talk
[2:02 AM] fancy: badger you rationalize until you're right
[2:02 AM] fancy: it's not very interesting
[2:02 AM] fancy: as far as I've ever known you never admit your'e wrong
[2:02 AM] fancy: that's all I have to say
[2:03 AM] fancy: yoshi gave you a vauge answer too
[2:03 AM] fancy: you just hate qwomen for some reaosn
[2:03 AM] A Random Badger: i never got back to yoshi because i was in the middle of dealing with you and nikki
[2:03 AM] A Random Badger: when i got his message
[2:03 AM] A Random Badger: and also
[2:03 AM] A Random Badger: i asked him to elaborate
[2:03 AM] A Random Badger: which he did
[2:04 AM] A Random Badger: at least
[2:04 AM] A Random Badger: and then he proceeded to ignore me
[2:04 AM] A Random Badger: at which point, if things had gone differently with nikki at least
[2:04 AM] A Random Badger: and she just talked to me
[2:04 AM] A Random Badger: i could've dealt with yoshi
[2:05 AM] A Random Badger: and if he insisted on ignoring me and not having a discussion about the issue
[2:05 AM] A Random Badger: i would've told him that he wouldn't be invited to tabletop if i was running it
[2:06 AM] A Random Badger: and i only admit when im wrong when its actually quite clear that i am wrong, and i actually have done that with you in the past
[2:06 AM] A Random Badger: a few times
[2:06 AM] A Random Badger: when we've gotten in arguments
[2:06 AM] fancy: can you go back to ignoring me please
[2:07 AM] A Random Badger: and when was i ignoring you lol
[2:08 AM] fancy: the last like two weeks
[2:08 AM] A Random Badger: i wasn't "ignoring you"
[2:08 AM] A Random Badger: we've been playing different games lol
[2:08 AM] A Random Badger: especially since tabletop dream fell apart
[2:08 AM] A Random Badger: tf
[2:09 AM] A Random Badger: and i still havent been too too interested in play mhw
[2:09 AM] A Random Badger: other than that we have been playing very different games lol
[2:12 AM] A Random Badger: anyways if we're not going to discuss the situation further, which i dont really think either of us want to do because we have very different opinions on it and aren't willing to budge on them at all, im going to bed
[2:12 AM] A Random Badger: goodnight
[2:24 PM] fancy: badger your life philosophy revolves around thinking you know best/have perfect rationalization. You operate off incomplete information just like everyone else, but you assume everyone knows as much as they need to. That's why you take things personally, because you feel people are out to get you, specifically. Just like they don't have all the information, neither do you, and yes that hinders everyone's ability to make good decisions.

People don't owe you a conversations, and when you start out by being rude and aggressive, they get turned off immediately. You would do the same. Get off the high horse, and stop writing off your mistakes as "oh well I didn't care anyway".
[2:25 PM] fancy: Life isn't a utopia, there isn't a god-tier standard of rationality that we can hold people to
[2:25 PM] fancy: No one operates that way
[2:25 PM] fancy: you can buck the system as much as you want, but you only hurt yourself
[2:45 PM] A Random Badger: if everyone could operate with complete information as if everyone was an open book then things would be much easier but that's not ever the case. you never get to operate with complete information, only with what you're given, and what you're given is all that is needed to know to do something. otherwise, if we always strove to obtain complete information without any idea of where to start or what is needed or what is left, nothing would ever get done. and yes as far as im concerned, all people operate in a way that is out to conquer everyone else in one way or another
2:46 PM] fancy: you're conflating a lot of things
[2:46 PM] fancy: it's not all or nothing
[2:46 PM] A Random Badger: and no, people don't owe me conversations, but if they're gonna get offended because i told them off because they only want to partake in half the effort of a conversation, instead of avoiding the conversation completely if they truly don't want to have it, then i say again, thats a huge them problem
[2:47 PM] fancy: and that's a bunch of not accepting any personal responsibility
[2:47 PM] A Random Badger: and i never did start out rude and aggressive
[2:47 PM] fancy: Nikki thought you did, you don't get to decide that
[2:47 PM] fancy: and yes badger, you are often aggressive and rude
[2:47 PM] fancy: I've known you how long?
[2:48 PM] fancy: you tell people off if you want them to never cooperate with you again
[2:48 PM] fancy: you don't do that if you have any desire to build any kind of productive anything
[2:48 PM] fancy: and no, just because you can't have all the information, doesn't mean you should act like you have all the information you need
[2:49 PM] fancy: it takes a little humility, but you have to keep in mind you're operating on incomplete information and that any assumptions you make can and will have consequences
[2:49 PM] fancy: and so you should probably choose to be less combative out of the gates
[2:50 PM] fancy: if your goal is something other than to piss people off
[2:54 PM] A Random Badger: i never stated that you should act is if you did, i stated that you have to act nonetheless because you can never truly attain complete information. and i did act with incomplete information. if me asking her about what she thought of tabletop, and if she'd like to keep playing again, and then asking her to elaborate her vague answer is "combative" and acting as if i know everything then yea, forgive me for being such a horribly rude person
[2:54 PM] A Random Badger: and when i told her off at the end, yes it was definitely with the intention of not wanting to cooperate again
[2:55 PM] fancy: it's about phrasing not content
[2:57 PM] A Random Badger: https://gyazo.com/d5387193bef41d9dcb9f18f632d91367
2:57 PM] A Random Badger: i fail to see it
[2:57 PM] fancy: this is an interrogation lol
[2:57 PM] A Random Badger: i fail to see this
[2:58 PM] A Random Badger: unless ofc
[2:58 PM] A Random Badger: questions always = interrogation
[2:58 PM] A Random Badger: and interrogation = questions
[2:58 PM] A Random Badger: and if not
[2:58 PM] A Random Badger: where is the difference
[2:58 PM] A Random Badger: when do we draw the line between
[2:58 PM] A Random Badger: innocent questions
[2:58 PM] A Random Badger: and
[2:58 PM] fancy: no
[2:58 PM] A Random Badger: "interrogating someone"
[2:59 PM] fancy: I mean I also can't see her responses
[2:59 PM] fancy: so
[2:59 PM] fancy: but yes you are kinda just throwing a bunch of vague leading questions at her
[2:59 PM] fancy: with 0 context
[2:59 PM] fancy: that's kinda how interrogations go
[2:59 PM] A Random Badger: well i couldnt get them all open at once
[2:59 PM] A Random Badger: but her responses were
[2:59 PM] A Random Badger: in order
[2:59 PM] A Random Badger: "yes"
[2:59 PM] A Random Badger: "possibly"
[2:59 PM] A Random Badger: "what that means"
[3:00 PM] fancy: and then what did you say
[3:00 PM] A Random Badger: i said what are the conditions, after she said possibly, and she said the "what that means"
[3:00 PM] A Random Badger: and then i said the
[3:00 PM] A Random Badger: "you said possibly"
[3:00 PM] A Random Badger: because i was confused
[3:00 PM] A Random Badger: as to what the conditions were
[3:00 PM] fancy: and then what after that
[3:00 PM] A Random Badger: of the possibility
[3:01 PM] A Random Badger: "why you asking me all these question"
[3:01 PM] fancy: yeah
[3:01 PM] fancy: valid question
[3:01 PM] fancy: since you haven't explained yourself at all
[3:01 PM] A Random Badger: and i told her because you were sick and tired of dealing with everyone
[3:01 PM] A Random Badger: and that i was going to step in to help
[3:01 PM] A Random Badger: and that i wanted to talk to nayone
[3:01 PM] A Random Badger: and that's when i got
[3:01 PM] A Random Badger: "fancy says im not the problem"
[3:02 PM] fancy: yes
[3:02 PM] fancy: that's when she messaged me and asked why you were interrogating her
[3:02 PM] fancy: and I told her to tell you that
[3:02 PM] A Random Badger: yes and i told her that i disagreed especially with her unwillingness to talk to be about the situation at all
[3:03 PM] fancy: sigh
[3:03 PM] fancy: that was where you should have said "oh" and moved on
[3:03 PM] fancy: because you don't have an argument with her you have one with me
[3:03 PM] fancy: at that point
[3:03 PM] fancy: you're going to bat for me but you weren't even confronting the issues I had lol
[3:04 PM] A Random Badger: i wasn't aiming at arguing with anyone, i just wanted to see what everyone thought about tabletop and if they were still interested so i would know if it was worth running it or not
[3:04 PM] fancy: okay so you weren't asking because I was sick of everyone
[3:04 PM] fancy: what you should have said was
[3:05 PM] fancy: "I'm trying to see if everyone is really interested in continuing because it's a fair amount of work for whoever hosts"
[3:05 PM] fancy: look
[3:05 PM] fancy: positive
[3:05 PM] fancy: not aggressive
3:05 PM] A Random Badger: but i wasn't allowed to get to that point at all lol because nikki refused to talk to me at all, quite evidently, throughout the entirety of the short conversation
[3:06 PM] A Random Badger: and thats when i told her off
[3:06 PM] fancy: wgat
[3:06 PM] fancy: what
[3:06 PM] fancy: u idiot
[3:06 PM] A Random Badger: cause i had no intention on playing with her anymore
[3:06 PM] fancy: instead of saying
[3:06 PM] fancy: "I'm asking you these questions because fancy is sick of everyone"
[3:06 PM] fancy: when she asked why you're asking these questions
[3:06 PM] fancy: you should have said the other thing
[3:06 PM] A Random Badger: i said both things
[3:07 PM] A Random Badger: actually
[3:07 PM] fancy: what I said
[3:07 PM] A Random Badger: i said that, and that i was going to be stepping up to run things
[3:07 PM] A Random Badger: from now on
[3:07 PM] fancy: yes but saying "cus fancy is sick of everyone" is aggressive and rude
[3:07 PM] A Random Badger: okay sure, i can see that
[3:08 PM] fancy: especially after I told her to tell you that she's not the problem
[3:08 PM] fancy: and then u keep going
[3:08 PM] fancy: of course she's gonna be like wtf
[3:08 PM] A Random Badger: but up until that point, i wasn't rude or aggressive at all, and she still insisted on hardly taking part in the conversation whatsoever
[3:08 PM] A Random Badger: evident by her
[3:08 PM] A Random Badger: half-assed replies each time
[3:08 PM] fancy: you asked
[3:08 PM] fancy: a yes or no question
[3:08 PM] fancy: and then
[3:08 PM] fancy: a yes or no question
[3:09 PM] fancy: you failed as much as she did
[3:09 PM] A Random Badger: to which i got neither yes or no
[3:09 PM] A Random Badger: sure
[3:09 PM] A Random Badger: ill admit that
[3:09 PM] A Random Badger: that i failed as much as she did
[3:09 PM] fancy: because the answer to the yes or no question was "depends on how everyone else feels"
[3:09 PM] fancy: and yet we're writing her off for being a bitch?
[3:09 PM] fancy: oh wait forgot
[3:09 PM] fancy: she's a woman
[3:09 PM] fancy: right
[3:09 PM] fancy: gotcha
3:10 PM] A Random Badger: actually, im not even sold on the being a woman thing, so im not even operating under that assumption
[3:10 PM] A Random Badger: tbh
[3:10 PM] fancy: you're retarded
[3:10 PM] fancy: I'm done with this conversation if you can't respect my friends
[3:10 PM] A Random Badger: well considering i've been through it once before
[3:10 PM] A Random Badger: im definitely suspicious of it
[3:11 PM] fancy: good theory
[3:11 PM] fancy: very big brain
[3:11 PM] A Random Badger: not in a way where i refuse to get along
[3:11 PM] A Random Badger: but in a way where im not going to assume
[3:11 PM] A Random Badger: either gender
[3:11 PM] fancy: you just refuse to trust her or accept what she says
[3:11 PM] fancy: you're the kind of person that would misgender a trans person cus you don't believe them
[3:11 PM] fancy: that's what you're doing
[3:15 PM] A Random Badger: no, i have trans friends that i support, but i've also had an online friend in the past, who operated exactly like nikki, and said he was female when he wasn't, for about 2 years of our friendship, because he thought it'd be easier to make friends that way, and then ended up digging that hole too deep and didn't know what to do except keep digging it deeper before he finally confessed that he lied about his identity, and we were all perfectly open to it and understanding, cause we had been friends for 2 years. and theres some more awkward details to that story too that i dont want to get into. but because of that experience, and because the situation is oddly familiar, yes im definitely suspicious in a slight way, but not in a way where i intend to be aggressive based on it. only to avoid being taken advantage of as i was once before
[3:15 PM] A Random Badger: so yes i "refuse to trust and accept what she says"
[3:15 PM] A Random Badger: for my own personal safety
[3:15 PM] A Random Badger: as unguided and unreasonable as it may be
[3:16 PM] A Random Badger: it is what it is
[3:16 PM] fancy: "personal safety"
[3:16 PM] A Random Badger: and no, im writing her off because she refused to be at all understanding and wrote me off first
[3:17 PM] fancy: because finding out someone's gender is different would be SO HARMFUL
[3:17 PM] A Random Badger: it is, if that person uses their supposed gender to try to take advantage of people
[3:17 PM] fancy: badger you can't expect someone to be understanding when you begin as hostile with someone you barely know
[3:17 PM] fancy: who the fuck is she taking advantage of
[3:17 PM] fancy: she doesn't even bring it up ever
[3:18 PM] fancy: if you wanna be a retard and throw money at girls just cus they're girls that's no one's problem but your own, it's not the gender doing it to you
[3:19 PM] fancy: I don't even understand what "using your gender to take advantage of someone" means
[3:20 PM] A Random Badger: and once again, i didn't begin hostile and i did make the mistake of being rude when i explained to her why i was asking questions, but then she wrote me off completely for that, despite even as you say we both failed at being understanding and cooperative. and sense i see no point or duty in repairing that bridge, i dont intend on doing anything with it
[3:20 PM] A Random Badger: like i said
[3:20 PM] A Random Badger: im not getting into it
[3:20 PM] A Random Badger: theres other details to that story
[3:20 PM] A Random Badger: that i do no owe anyone
[3:20 PM] A Random Badger: and she's not taking advantage of anyone
3:20 PM] fancy: the interrogation is hostile
[3:20 PM] A Random Badger: but i sure as hell aint gonna take the risk either
[3:20 PM] A Random Badger: is my stance
[3:20 PM] fancy: the "fancy hates u all" is hostile
[3:21 PM] fancy: you didn't even present any positives until fucking 4 points in
[3:21 PM] A Random Badger: i still fail to see my initial lines of questions as "interrogation"
[3:21 PM] fancy: then I can't help you
[3:21 PM] A Random Badger: im not asking for help lol
[3:21 PM] fancy: I don't see how gravity exists
[3:21 PM] fancy: that's equivalent to what you're saying
[3:21 PM] fancy: it does
[3:21 PM] fancy: and it is
[3:22 PM] fancy: requiring someone to justify themselves to you with no context is an interrogation
[3:22 PM] fancy: you're incredibly arrogant to assume she would reasonably just have gone along with it
[3:22 PM] fancy: I would have had the same response
[3:23 PM] A Random Badger: hmm i wasn't "requiring justification" in any of my initial questions. unless ofc asking someone if they enjoy smth and if they wanna keep doing it is that case
[3:23 PM] A Random Badger: then i guess im wrong
[3:23 PM] fancy: yes you were
[3:23 PM] A Random Badger: but i fail to see that case
[3:23 PM] fancy: "what are the conditions"
[3:23 PM] fancy: your phrasing was all very cold
[3:23 PM] fancy: and not friendly and cooperative at all
[3:24 PM] A Random Badger: yanno this conversation could've been ended a while ago when we came to the earlier agreement, but it sounds a lot like you're the one just trying to push for some kind of moral victory in this argument now
[3:24 PM] fancy: what
[3:24 PM] fancy: that's a very large red herring
[3:25 PM] A Random Badger: you asked
a yes or no question
and then
a yes or no question
you failed as much as she did
A Random BadgerToday at 3:09 PM
to which i got neither yes or no
sure
ill admit that
that i failed as much as she did
[3:25 PM] A Random Badger: we easily could've ended here
[3:25 PM] A Random Badger: and came to this argreement
[3:25 PM] A Random Badger: and moved on
[3:25 PM] fancy: no because for some reason you've decided what she did was way worse
[3:25 PM] fancy: because that's how you're acting
[3:25 PM] A Random Badger: i already told you
[3:25 PM] A Random Badger: that i agree
[3:25 PM] fancy: "let's just burn bridges cus why not"
[3:25 PM] A Random Badger: that we were both equally at fault in that conversation
[3:25 PM] A Random Badger: lmao
[3:25 PM] A Random Badger: i never said
3:25 PM] fancy: you're not acting that way
[3:25 PM] fancy: at all
[3:26 PM] A Random Badger: what she did was wrose
[3:26 PM] A Random Badger: okay lol
[3:26 PM] fancy: words are cheap
[3:26 PM] A Random Badger: says the man who keeps pushing to win an non-existent verbal war after winning one battle
[3:26 PM] A Random Badger: instead of calling a truce
[3:26 PM] fancy: oh my god you're so dense
[3:27 PM] A Random Badger: you're the one who then decided
[3:27 PM] fancy: because you're writing her off for no fucking reason
[3:27 PM] A Random Badger: "oh lets move into your problems with women while we're at it"
[3:27 PM] A Random Badger: and thats a me problem lol
[3:27 PM] A Random Badger: its no up for discussion
[3:27 PM] A Random Badger: not*
[3:27 PM] fancy: yeah I took a shot at your fucking horrendous view on women
[3:28 PM] A Random Badger: well when you experience the same things i have with women, maybe one day you understand lol
[3:28 PM] fancy: LOL
[3:28 PM] fancy: such incel propoganda
[3:28 PM] A Random Badger: now im an incel lol
[3:28 PM] fancy: no
[3:28 PM] fancy: what you said
[3:28 PM] fancy: sounds like what they say
[3:28 PM] A Random Badger: oh sure idk
[3:29 PM] A Random Badger: all im saying is
[3:29 PM] A Random Badger: i have very
[3:29 PM] A Random Badger: major
[3:29 PM] A Random Badger: trust issues with women
[3:29 PM] fancy: you have issues with people
[3:29 PM] A Random Badger: and i dont trust any of them romantically at this point
[3:29 PM] fancy: and it's partially your own fault
[3:29 PM] fancy: oh please
[3:29 PM] fancy: you top my Ashley story?
[3:29 PM] fancy: I'd like to see that
[3:30 PM] A Random Badger: why does it have to be a competition lol
[3:30 PM] fancy: because it has nothing to do with women
[3:30 PM] fancy: you just want it to
[3:30 PM] A Random Badger: "my trauma is far greater than yours so i cant see how you're more effected than i am"
[3:30 PM] fancy: so you don't have to face the music
3:30 PM] A Random Badger: "hurr durr"
[3:30 PM] fancy: this is like having a bad experience with some black people and then writing them ALL off
[3:30 PM] A Random Badger: ive never brought up my trauma's to women with you
[3:30 PM] fancy: not the point
[3:30 PM] A Random Badger: and especially now why would i
[3:30 PM] A Random Badger: with the
[3:31 PM] fancy: you're just victimizing yourself
[3:31 PM] fancy: oh yes
[3:31 PM] A Random Badger: "my story is worse than yours"
[3:31 PM] fancy: cus I refuse to blame all women for my problems
[3:31 PM] A Random Badger: bs
[3:31 PM] fancy: how awful of me
[3:31 PM] fancy: Jesus Christ badger
[3:31 PM] fancy: you're disgusting
[3:31 PM] A Random Badger: you're the one who brought it up as an argument
[3:31 PM] fancy: BECAUSE ITS A HUGE PROBLEM
[3:32 PM] A Random Badger: as if it had any validity to my trauma's that you have no knowledge about
[3:32 PM] fancy: it does
[3:32 PM] fancy: because the point isn't the story
[3:32 PM] fancy: the point is
[3:32 PM] fancy: it's not about women.
[3:32 PM] fancy: it's people.
[3:32 PM] fancy: but you single women out
[3:32 PM] fancy: for unknown reasons
[3:32 PM] A Random Badger: it sounds a whole lot more like you're trying to draw a comparison to my trauma and yours and make it a competition
[3:32 PM] A Random Badger: in order to invalidate the way i feel
[3:32 PM] fancy: yes
[3:32 PM] fancy: you feel an invalid way
[3:33 PM] fancy: about all women
[3:33 PM] fancy: this is fact
[3:33 PM] A Random Badger: and i agree, but they are still feelings that i cannot just shake off at this point
[3:33 PM] fancy: ascribing traits to a huge population because of specific occurrences is invalid
[3:33 PM] A Random Badger: they're very unreasonable feelings
[3:33 PM] fancy: that's the most cop out answer I've ever heard
[3:33 PM] A Random Badger: and im seeking therapy to tackle them
[3:33 PM] fancy: god you actually are defending hating women
[3:33 PM] A Random Badger: i never said anything about hating women lol
[3:34 PM] fancy: :nikkiHmm:
[3:34 PM] A Random Badger: i still have friends that are women
[3:34 PM] A Random Badger: the only thing i said
[3:34 PM] fancy: you just don't trust them
[3:34 PM] fancy: cus they have boobs.
[3:34 PM] A Random Badger: is that i have major romantic trust issues
[3:34 PM] A Random Badger: yes because i have very major concerns
[3:34 PM] A Random Badger: that just about all women are manipulative, unfaithful and cruel
[3:35 PM] A Random Badger: and it has gotten to the point where im no longer see the point in taking the risk
[3:35 PM] A Random Badger: and yes, its unreasonable
3:35 PM] fancy: "all women are manipulative unfaithful and cruel" 

"I don't hate women :smiley: "
[3:35 PM] A Random Badger: but its not something i cna unpack on my own
[3:35 PM] fancy: you single out women... why.
[3:36 PM] A Random Badger: why? because they're the ones im sexually and romantically attracted to and the ones that have done me harm, not men
[3:36 PM] A Random Badger: ofc
[3:36 PM] A Random Badger: men are also these ways sometimes
[3:36 PM] A Random Badger: and women go through bad shit
[3:37 PM] A Random Badger: with these types of men
[3:37 PM] A Random Badger: and men are also bad
[3:37 PM] fancy: oh my god "men are like this sometimes"
"all women are like this always"
[3:37 PM] fancy: NO INEQUALITY HERE
[3:37 PM] fancy: NOPE
[3:37 PM] A Random Badger: you're right there
[3:37 PM] fancy: ur being a walking example of bad data
[3:37 PM] A Random Badger: yep
[3:38 PM] A Random Badger: but that doesn't mean it hasn't had a major negative effect on me
[3:38 PM] A Random Badger: that i cannot overcome on my own
[3:38 PM] A Random Badger: regardless of whether or not that i want to believe otherwise
[3:39 PM] A Random Badger: but you're the psychology major who knows how to unpack all of this
[3:39 PM] A Random Badger: and im just
[3:40 PM] A Random Badger: objectively wrong for feeling the way i do
[3:40 PM] fancy: I'm baffled that you're defending having bad reasoning
[3:40 PM] fancy: when you herald logic
[3:40 PM] fancy: and rationality
[3:40 PM] fancy: and yes, being upset with all women for what a few have done, but giving men a pass for the same, is objectively wrong
[3:41 PM] fancy: you treat them differently
[3:41 PM] fancy: even tho the crime is the same
[3:42 PM] A Random Badger: yep, but i dont actually treat women differently, i dont hold them with contempt and berate them whenever i see them, or am drawn to aggressiveness more than with anyone else
[3:42 PM] A Random Badger: the only effect it actually holds on me rn
[3:42 PM] A Random Badger: is that i no longer have any romantic desire in women
[3:43 PM] fancy: and you don't trust them
3:43 PM] A Random Badger: not in a romantic sense
[3:43 PM] A Random Badger: no
[3:43 PM] A Random Badger: i believe women can be good human beings, and good friends and i have ones that are
[3:43 PM] A Random Badger: but romantically
[3:43 PM] fancy: and you expect me to believe you've perfectly compartmentalized that?
[3:43 PM] A Random Badger: i can't bring myself to trust
[3:44 PM] A Random Badger: compartmentalized?
[3:44 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[3:44 PM] A Random Badger: yes
[3:44 PM] A Random Badger: ig
[3:44 PM] A Random Badger: idk lol
[3:44 PM] A Random Badger: i dont
[3:44 PM] A Random Badger: "expect"
[3:44 PM] A Random Badger: you to believe anything
[3:44 PM] fancy: boring
[3:44 PM] A Random Badger: because what you "believe" doesn't matter
[3:44 PM] fancy: move on from this
[3:44 PM] fancy: answer the question
[3:44 PM] A Random Badger: what question
[3:45 PM] A Random Badger: actually
[3:45 PM] A Random Badger: idc what the question is
[3:45 PM] A Random Badger: i dont think i owe you an answer at this point
[3:45 PM] fancy: LOL
[3:45 PM] fancy: burn this bridge too then
[3:45 PM] fancy: good on u
[3:45 PM] fancy: sticking it to the man
[3:46 PM] A Random Badger: im not burning the bridge, im just ending this particular discussion
[3:46 PM] A Random Badger: because i think you've been very unfair and unreasonable when you don't actually have a full understanding of what im going through, how i feel and why i feel the way that i do, but you act as if you have "complete information"
[3:46 PM] fancy: would you confront one of your friends if they talked about how much they don't trust black people and would never date them
[3:46 PM] A Random Badger: wow look how that backfired
[3:47 PM] fancy: badger there is no info that justifies extrapolating a subset of women to the entire set of women
[3:47 PM] fancy: that's called sexism
[3:47 PM] fancy: if you said "I can't date ever for a while at least"
[3:47 PM] fancy: I'd sympathize with you
[3:47 PM] fancy: but when you say "I can't date women for a while at least"
[3:47 PM] fancy: I can't
[3:48 PM] A Random Badger: because saying "for a while" when i have no idea if these are feelings i can even overcome at this point
[3:48 PM] A Random Badger: is unreasonable
[3:48 PM] fancy: I typi
[3:48 PM] fancy: typo
[3:48 PM] fancy: make the two sentences equivalent
[3:48 PM] fancy: except for mentioning women
[3:49 PM] A Random Badger: well considering im only interested in dating women
[3:49 PM] A Random Badger: hmm
[3:49 PM] A Random Badger: and what im saying is
[3:49 PM] A Random Badger: rn at least
[3:49 PM] A Random Badger: is i have no intention on dating ever again
[3:49 PM] fancy: idk I don't believe in that
[3:49 PM] fancy: like
[3:50 PM] fancy: in love being binary
3:50 PM] A Random Badger: unless i or a therapist is somehow able to unpack my shit and i can get over it
[3:50 PM] A Random Badger: then yea i have absolutely no intention on dating anyone whatsoever, ever again
[3:51 PM] A Random Badger: and if i was attracted to men
[3:51 PM] A Random Badger: that would include them too
[3:51 PM] fancy: hmm
[3:51 PM] fancy: that's more reasonable
[3:52 PM] A Random Badger: hmm if only you ever actually gave me the opportunity to explain to you what i feel in detail and why i feel that way
[3:52 PM] fancy: I asked many times
[3:52 PM] fancy: why are you making it about women
[3:52 PM] A Random Badger: oh you mean
[3:52 PM] fancy: rather I said that
[3:52 PM] fancy: many times
[3:52 PM] A Random Badger: inside the barrage of
[3:52 PM] fancy: you're making it only about women
[3:52 PM] A Random Badger: "your disgusting"
[3:53 PM] fancy: yeah because hating women is disgusting lol
[3:53 PM] fancy: this isn't the first time we've talked about this
[3:53 PM] fancy: last time we talked about it
[3:53 PM] A Random Badger: and you're operating under the assumption that i hate women lmao
[3:53 PM] fancy: I said you sounded misogynistic
[3:53 PM] A Random Badger: when i never stated
[3:53 PM] fancy: and you said you were okay with that
[3:53 PM] A Random Badger: that i do
[3:54 PM] A Random Badger: yes to avoid the conversation lol
[3:54 PM] A Random Badger: and as i explained
[3:54 PM] A Random Badger: i dont hate women
[3:54 PM] A Random Badger: i just am not able to bring myself to trust them in a romantic relationship
[3:54 PM] fancy: ur
[3:55 PM] fancy: foolish
[3:55 PM] fancy: lol
[3:55 PM] fancy: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/300058957530005504/568162623435177998/Screenshot_20190417-155439.png
[3:55 PM] fancy: this kind of thing
[3:55 PM] fancy: u should be more careful of your words lol
[3:55 PM] fancy: congrats ur back to just being a dummy
[3:56 PM] fancy: instead of a misogynist
[3:56 PM] A Random Badger: sure
[3:56 PM] A Random Badger: okay im done with this now
[3:56 PM] fancy: ur gonna
[3:56 PM] fancy: be less aggressive
[3:56 PM] fancy: and more aware
[3:56 PM] fancy: good
[3:56 PM] fancy: gotcha
[3:56 PM] A Random Badger: oh no, i still have no intention on repairing the bridge with nikki if that's what you're getting at
[3:57 PM] A Random Badger: but yea sure
[3:57 PM] A Random Badger: im gonna be more aware
[3:57 PM] A Random Badger: of what i say
[3:57 PM] fancy: oh god
[3:57 PM] fancy: okay next week we discuss why we shouldn't burn bridges for no reason
[3:57 PM] fancy: AND ALSO
[3:57 PM] fancy: how it's more useful to have more relationships than fewer
[4:01 PM] A Random Badger: well i dont have any similar interests with nikki or talk to her so theres really no solid foundation for a lasting friendship anyways
[4:02 PM] fancy: you and I have barely any similar interests
[4:02 PM] fancy: besides arguing
[4:02 PM] A Random Badger: especially once you include my trust issues over her hiding her identity and my will to keep her at the end of a very long pole
[4:02 PM] A Random Badger: well i use interests to encompass a broad range of activities
[4:02 PM] A Random Badger: including games and stuff
[4:02 PM] fancy: we have 1
[4:02 PM] fancy: it's arguing
4:03 PM] A Random Badger: we at elast have game we enjoy together
[4:03 PM] fancy: u don't play my games lol
[4:03 PM] fancy: when was the last time
[4:03 PM] A Random Badger: i used to lol
[4:03 PM] fancy: Okay
[4:03 PM] fancy: so
[4:03 PM] fancy: I say again
[4:03 PM] fancy: u and I don't share interests
[4:03 PM] fancy: lol
[4:03 PM] A Random Badger: i wouldn't say im not interested just because i dont play it.
[4:03 PM] fancy: what do you mean hiding her identity
[4:03 PM] A Random Badger: im still interested in dota and mhw and stuff
[4:03 PM] A Random Badger: and that new game
[4:04 PM] A Random Badger: im just playing other things
[4:04 PM] A Random Badger: and dota is too stressful for me
[4:04 PM] A Random Badger: and also we enjoy DnD
[4:04 PM] A Random Badger: etc
[4:04 PM] A Random Badger: we have several interests
[4:04 PM] A Random Badger: and i mean how she
[4:05 PM] A Random Badger: has no mic to communicate with us for w.e reason and doesn't really share many details about her life
[4:05 PM] fancy: what do you know about Julian
[4:05 PM] fancy: also if you talked to her she would share details about her life lol
[4:05 PM] A Random Badger: i know that he grew up with pizza and i've seen pictures of him and i have heard his voice
[4:06 PM] fancy: so that's what knowing someone is?
[4:06 PM] fancy: lol
[4:07 PM] A Random Badger: well i can at least operate under the presumption that he's not hiding behind a different identity online to possibly take advantage of others
[4:07 PM] A Random Badger: as someone i once knew did
[4:07 PM] fancy: based on what
[4:07 PM] A Random Badger: who operated the same way as nikki currently does
[4:07 PM] fancy: some pictures he could have faked?
[4:07 PM] fancy: and stories that maybe we all made up together?
[4:08 PM] A Random Badger: far more unlikely
[4:08 PM] fancy: arbitrarily lol
[4:08 PM] fancy: what could she even be lying about
[4:08 PM] fancy: if you don't know anything about her
[4:10 PM] A Random Badger: as i said, i keep her at the end of a long pole because i have no desire to get close to her, including getting to know her
[4:10 PM] fancy: based on....
[4:10 PM] fancy: ?
[4:10 PM] A Random Badger: all i do know is she insists she's a woman who lives in the north but for some reason doesn't use a mic despite how many online games she plays with online friends
[4:11 PM] A Random Badger: and to me
[4:11 PM] fancy: uhh
[4:11 PM] A Random Badger: its suspicious
4:11 PM] fancy: does she even insist that
[4:11 PM] fancy: there's a million reasons why one wouldn't use a mic
[4:12 PM] A Random Badger: why doesn't nikki use a mic then
[4:13 PM] fancy: ask her
[4:13 PM] A Random Badger: no thx rather not
[4:13 PM] fancy: she almost never brings up that she's a girl
[4:13 PM] fancy: ok so you're admitting that you're basing this decision off of basically nothing?
[4:13 PM] A Random Badger: yea pretty much
[4:13 PM] A Random Badger: other than
[4:14 PM] A Random Badger: i knew someone else who didn't have a mic and insisted they were female and took advantage of people and dug his hole too deep
[4:14 PM] A Random Badger: and for me
[4:14 PM] fancy: so because she doesn't have a mic
[4:14 PM] A Random Badger: no ty not going near that
[4:14 PM] fancy: she somehow fits that now
[4:14 PM] fancy: I see
[4:15 PM] fancy: you herald rationality?
[4:15 PM] fancy: unrelated question
[4:15 PM] A Random Badger: uh idk lol
[4:15 PM] fancy: what's more important
[4:15 PM] fancy: reason or feelings
[4:16 PM] A Random Badger: reason
[4:16 PM] fancy: ok
[4:16 PM] fancy: just checking
[4:16 PM] A Random Badger: but as i said, no real reason to get to know nikki
[4:16 PM] A Random Badger: i have no common interests with her anyways
[4:16 PM] A Random Badger: at all
[4:16 PM] fancy: you have the same interests with her as I do
[4:16 PM] fancy: I mean
[4:16 PM] fancy: as with me
[4:17 PM] A Random Badger: well i wouldnt really call mhw one
[4:17 PM] A Random Badger: based on how
[4:17 PM] A Random Badger: she basically doesnt actually play
[4:17 PM] A Random Badger: which is pretty annoying imo
[4:17 PM] fancy: neither do you
[4:18 PM] fancy: once every 2 months doesn't count
[4:18 PM] fancy: counts as much as she does
4:18 PM] A Random Badger: well when i come on to play, i actually play. i dont just sit afk in camp or go fishing
[4:18 PM] A Random Badger: so
[4:18 PM] A Random Badger: idk
[4:18 PM] fancy: yeah and you do that once in 2 months maybe
[4:18 PM] fancy: so to me
[4:18 PM] fancy: comparatively
[4:18 PM] fancy: you're the same
[4:18 PM] fancy: that's all I'm saying
[4:18 PM] A Random Badger: okay sure
[4:19 PM] A Random Badger: dota sure but i never played dota with nikki, and since i have no reason to play dota theres no reasoning to talk to her about dota
[4:19 PM] A Random Badger: unless it was about the pro scene
[4:19 PM] A Random Badger: but i actually have no interest in that
[4:19 PM] A Random Badger: or the streamer scene
[4:19 PM] fancy: you also don't talk to me about dota
[4:20 PM] A Random Badger: other than that yea theres nothing else
[4:20 PM] A Random Badger: no because there's nothing really interesting about dota anymore to me
[4:20 PM] A Random Badger: other than
[4:20 PM] A Random Badger: when like a new hero comes out
[4:20 PM] A Random Badger: or there was a big patch
[4:20 PM] A Random Badger: then i join in conversation then sometimes
[4:20 PM] A Random Badger: like with last big patch
[4:20 PM] A Random Badger: and with mars release
[4:21 PM] A Random Badger: and i've only ever really talked to you directly about it
[4:21 PM] A Random Badger: because you're the one i played with in the past
[4:21 PM] A Random Badger: and pizza
[4:21 PM] A Random Badger: otherwise i wouldn't join at all
[4:22 PM] fancy: sooo
[4:22 PM] fancy: same interests with me as her
[4:22 PM] A Random Badger: i mean we're also interested in that new game
[4:22 PM] A Random Badger: and dnd
[4:22 PM] A Random Badger: and arguing
[4:22 PM] fancy: what new game
[4:22 PM] A Random Badger: that new one you just got
[4:22 PM] fancy: we haven't ever talked about dnd
[4:22 PM] A Random Badger: that you wanted me to get
[4:23 PM] fancy: yes which you didn't
[4:23 PM] A Random Badger: no because no money yet lol
[4:23 PM] A Random Badger: still waiting on taxes
[4:23 PM] A Random Badger: to come in
[4:23 PM] A Random Badger: then i will prob
[4:23 PM] A Random Badger: if youre still playing it
[4:23 PM] A Random Badger: and yes we have lol, at least a few times about playing it
[4:23 PM] A Random Badger: and we've played it once or twice in the past 2
[4:24 PM] fancy: we played it once like three years ago
[4:25 PM] fancy: and I had to sedate u cus u tried to get us killed
4:25 PM] A Random Badger: lol yes
[4:25 PM] fancy: idiot
[4:25 PM] fancy: xd
[4:25 PM] A Random Badger: but i wouldn't say it's not common interest
[4:25 PM] A Random Badger: because it is
[4:25 PM] fancy: yeah but we don't talk about it hardly ever
[4:25 PM] A Random Badger: but we dont need to
[4:26 PM] fancy: :nikkiHmm:
[4:26 PM] A Random Badger: because we've built our friendship off of these interests when we were interested in them together at the time and doing them
[4:26 PM] A Random Badger: like when i was actively playing dota
[4:26 PM] A Random Badger: and trying csgo
[4:26 PM] A Random Badger: and getting you to try wow
[4:26 PM] A Random Badger: and when we gotmhw
[4:26 PM] fancy: it's interesting you think that just carries on forever
[4:26 PM] A Random Badger: wym
[4:26 PM] A Random Badger: i mean
[4:27 PM] fancy: like
[4:27 PM] fancy: it's just a set and forget thing
[4:27 PM] A Random Badger: if we don't find another games that interests us equally in the future
[4:27 PM] A Random Badger: and get back together playing regularly
[4:27 PM] A Random Badger: then yea we may fade apart a bit
[4:27 PM] fancy: hmmm
[4:27 PM] fancy: interesting
[4:27 PM] fancy: I don't view relationships the same at all
[4:27 PM] A Random Badger: well idk then
[4:27 PM] fancy: what you mean you don't know lol
[4:28 PM] fancy: it was a sentence
[4:28 PM] fancy: a full thought
[4:28 PM] fancy: not a question
[4:28 PM] fancy: xd
[4:29 PM] A Random Badger: yes
[4:29 PM] A Random Badger: nvm
