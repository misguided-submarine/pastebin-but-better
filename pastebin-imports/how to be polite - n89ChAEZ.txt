[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: hooray
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: read up
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: and we can
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: deliberate
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: or w.e the word is
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: idk
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: i go put dishes away
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: and get comfortable
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: while you read
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: fancy i still havent read those messages you sent me
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: so ig ill do that first
[7:34 PM] A Random Badger: xD
[7:34 PM] pizza: oof
[7:35 PM] fancy: u dingus
[7:35 PM] pizza: :Hmmm:
[7:36 PM] A Random Badger: okay i read it i will respond to those here momentarily
[7:39 PM] A Random Badger: okay keep in mind btw i never saw the argument you guys had
[7:39 PM] fancy: pizza you have a lot more context with not paying attention than anyone else
[7:39 PM] A Random Badger: so i have next to ingo on that
[7:39 PM] fancy: Yoshi very much pays attention when he and I do things
[7:39 PM] pizza: I agree that it was rude
[7:39 PM] A Random Badger: info
[7:39 PM] fancy: and he doesn't get lost in simple conversations
[7:39 PM] A Random Badger: also keep in mind
[7:40 PM] A Random Badger: that i am the counselor and it is my verdict that matters in this court room
[7:40 PM] A Random Badger: ty
[7:40 PM] pizza: but i think it's being a bit blown out of proportion. and I also think that there's no way you can think i never showed interest in learning/playing poker
[7:40 PM] pizza: badger shut
[7:40 PM] fancy: poker wasn't your fault
[7:40 PM] pizza: ur a moderator
[7:40 PM] pizza: not a judge
[7:40 PM] pizza: u don't even have a robe or gavel
[7:40 PM] fancy: but 100% I'm less mad at Julian and Yoshi for just leaving instead of drawing it out
[7:40 PM] A Random Badger: :hammer:
[7:40 PM] A Random Badger: this'll word
[7:40 PM] A Random Badger: work*
[7:41 PM] A Random Badger: personally i think they're both equally at fault for ruining the night tbf
[7:41 PM] A Random Badger: because they chose not to speak up and give their opinions on what they wanted to do
[7:41 PM] A Random Badger: and instead just decided to ditch entirely
[7:41 PM] fancy: that's a common theme
[7:41 PM] fancy: across the last 4 years
[7:41 PM] A Random Badger: leaving the rest of us with nothing
[7:42 PM] fancy: I mean I'm okay with that
[7:42 PM] fancy: we didn't invest much into poker
[7:42 PM] fancy: I'm much happier they just left
7:42 PM] fancy: after like 3 hands
[7:42 PM] fancy: than me having to ping them 5 times every turn to go
[7:42 PM] fancy: like did they leave in a little bit of a rude way? of course
[7:42 PM] fancy: they could just stood up
[7:42 PM] fancy: cus u can do 4 person poker
[7:43 PM] fancy: it's not ideal but it's ok
[7:43 PM] A Random Badger: i agree
[7:43 PM] fancy: especially if learning
[7:43 PM] pizza: or they could have just said "hey i don't want to do dinner tonight i'm gonna pass"
[7:43 PM] fancy: so yes they could have been better but it's not as bad as drawing it out
[7:43 PM] fancy: which is what we all usually do
[7:43 PM] A Random Badger: but it's still not fair to take out your frustrations on only one of the 3 factors
[7:43 PM] fancy: baby steps
[7:44 PM] A Random Badger: imo
[7:44 PM] fancy: that's not true
[7:44 PM] fancy: because pizza did something way worse
[7:44 PM] fancy: and it's something he has terrible history with
[7:44 PM] fancy: and he and I have talked about this
[7:44 PM] fancy: and he 100% is showing to me that he thinks my feelings about are invalid
[7:44 PM] pizza: can you remind me of the other times i've had this issue
[7:44 PM] fancy: not paying attention ?
[7:45 PM] fancy: FOR THE PAST 7 YEARS
[7:45 PM] pizza: yes some reminders please
[7:45 PM] pizza: memory not so good
[7:45 PM] fancy: you blank out in the middle of conversations cus you watch youtube
[7:45 PM] fancy: or play a game
[7:45 PM] fancy: just the other day we talked about how I don't like having to organize shit and then beg everyone to get here
[7:45 PM] fancy: that's the same as begging them to play their turn
[7:46 PM] fancy: you join discord and then stop talking cus you queued for a ranked game
[7:47 PM] fancy: and you expect me to buy that you were engaged in the game while also trying to do MC?
[7:47 PM] fancy: that's delusional
[7:47 PM] fancy: 100%
[7:47 PM] pizza: tbh, i joined dicsord while i was queuing for a ranked game already, and then couldn't focus on talking and playing at the same time
[7:47 PM] fancy: that's worse lol
[7:47 PM] fancy: that's like knowing you have plans for something and then make other plans that overlap and then ghost in the middle of the new plans
[7:51 PM] pizza: i started messing with mc in the second game bc i was losing interest in the game, the first round i was engaged in and asking questions, and i pretty actively participated. Julian and Yoshi never seemed like they were into it or cared about the game, and I think i speak for most people when I say that it's hard to take nikki seriously when she's constantly just shouting memes and saying that x person is hitler
[7:52 PM] pizza: i also never understood how killing julian fucked us over temporarily until badger explained it like 20 minutes ago
[7:52 PM] fancy: and yet Nikki probably won one of the games for us
[7:52 PM] fancy: so I don't even know if killing Julian fucked us
[7:52 PM] fancy: I was throwing ideas out
[7:52 PM] pizza: and i still don't even know how nikki contributed
[7:52 PM] fancy: you assume I have any idea what I'm talking about
7:52 PM] pizza: even if she probably did
[7:52 PM] pizza: i have no clue
[7:52 PM] fancy: I have played 4 games
[7:52 PM] fancy: CUS U DONT PAY ATTENTION LOL
[7:53 PM] fancy: she suggested the idea of passing the vote
[7:53 PM] fancy: to get a 50-50 to win
[7:53 PM] A Random Badger: tbf that felt like the only time she participated seriously in the whole game
[7:53 PM] A Random Badger: the rest of all games were x person is hitler meme
[7:53 PM] A Random Badger: which while now i can understand why she did that
[7:54 PM] A Random Badger: and it was a way for her to fish for reactions
[7:54 PM] A Random Badger: its still no wonder why i wasnt the only one who thought nikki wasnt playing seriously and some of us began to lose interest
[7:54 PM] A Random Badger: now yes pizza was very rude the way he handled the situation
[7:54 PM] pizza: yes
[7:54 PM] A Random Badger: and the whole thing couldve been avoided
[7:54 PM] pizza: i was
[7:55 PM] A Random Badger: by saying hey while we're playing i wanna set up a shader pack
[7:55 PM] A Random Badger: but ill still be listening as much as possible
[7:55 PM] A Random Badger: also you should've said
[7:55 PM] A Random Badger: hey im not understanding whats going on
[7:55 PM] fancy: wait no
[7:55 PM] fancy: hold on
[7:55 PM] A Random Badger: and it doesnt seem like people are playing serioudly
[7:55 PM] fancy: I have to pahse you
[7:55 PM] fancy: cus
[7:55 PM] fancy: this is not a solved point
[7:56 PM] fancy: I think even telling us that he's going to start doing something else in the middle is rude
[7:56 PM] fancy: like
[7:56 PM] fancy: that's not okay
[7:56 PM] fancy: it's not any better
[7:56 PM] fancy: that's just a verbal fuck you instead of a nonverbal one
[7:56 PM] A Random Badger: if you'd direct your attention to my 2nd suggestion
[7:56 PM] A Random Badger: of what he should've done
[7:56 PM] A Random Badger: xd
[7:57 PM] fancy: whay
[7:57 PM] fancy: you're gonna have to rephrase
[7:57 PM] A Random Badger: that he should've said
[7:57 PM] fancy: because it 100% seems like you're saying it would be okay to say that you're done paying attention
[7:57 PM] A Random Badger: hey im not udnerstanding whats going on
[7:57 PM] A Random Badger: and people dont seem like they're playing seriously
[7:57 PM] A Random Badger: can we discuss x and y
[7:57 PM] A Random Badger: or play something else if people aren't playing seriously
[7:58 PM] fancy: I don't see how that's related
[7:58 PM] fancy: but sure
[7:58 PM] A Random Badger: wat
[7:58 PM] fancy: like those seem like two different things
[7:58 PM] fancy: like you should either say
[7:59 PM] fancy: uhhh
[7:59 PM] fancy: like it's never okay
[7:59 PM] fancy: to start another thing
[7:59 PM] A Random Badger: im not saying that
[7:59 PM] fancy: while you're supposedly putting attention to something else
[7:59 PM] fancy: well your wording did
[7:59 PM] A Random Badger: @pizza
[7:59 PM] A Random Badger: did my wording come off wrong?
[7:59 PM] fancy: what you said was
[8:00 PM] A Random Badger: i said what he did was rude
[8:00 PM] fancy: everything could have been avoided by saying that "hey I wanna set up shader pack but I'll still be paying attention as much as possible"
[8:00 PM] A Random Badger: or
[8:00 PM] fancy: and I 100% disagree
[8:00 PM] A Random Badger: my 2nd suggestions
[8:00 PM] pizza: i think you're just disagreeing there's no wording problem
[8:00 PM] fancy: no there is no or, that's not an acceptable option ever
[8:00 PM] fancy: only your second suggestion is correct ever
[8:01 PM] fancy: that first bit is 95% as bad as what he did
[8:01 PM] A Random Badger: okay and you are nitpicking this why
[8:01 PM] fancy: so I have a question for you
[8:01 PM] fancy: if I said
[8:01 PM] fancy: you could have done this better by doing A or B
[8:01 PM] fancy: but A is just as bad as the thing you were doing already
[8:01 PM] fancy: that's not really an option
[8:01 PM] fancy: right?
[8:01 PM] A Random Badger: i disagree
[8:02 PM] A Random Badger: because at least if he's vocal  about what he was doing
[8:02 PM] A Random Badger: we could've asked him
[8:02 PM] fancy: Here I have more specific example
[8:02 PM] A Random Badger: why he wasnt interested
[8:02 PM] A Random Badger: and we could've moved into point B
[8:02 PM] fancy: uhhh maybe but even asking that is rude
[8:02 PM] A Random Badger: a lot less rude than saying nothing if you ask me
[8:02 PM] fancy: only marginally
[8:02 PM] fancy: like 5%
8:02 PM] fancy: but anyway
[8:02 PM] A Random Badger: because at least conversation can be had
[8:03 PM] A Random Badger: about why that person feels the need to do that
[8:03 PM] fancy: I'm not comfortable establishing it as an acceptable alternative
[8:03 PM] A Random Badger: ofc option B is best
[8:03 PM] fancy: option B is acceptable
[8:03 PM] fancy: A is not
[8:03 PM] fancy: A is rude, B is not
[8:03 PM] fancy: just cus A is less rude than saying "fuck you all I hate you" doesn't make it not rude
[8:03 PM] A Random Badger: and im not saying that
[8:03 PM] A Random Badger: im just giving alternatives
[8:03 PM] A Random Badger: moving on
[8:04 PM] A Random Badger: cause theres no point dwelling on one petty topic
[8:04 PM] A Random Badger: as we seem to be doing
[8:04 PM] fancy: as long as we understand that I do not see that as a viable alternative
[8:04 PM] fancy: but I agree with the second part
[8:04 PM] fancy: yes
[8:04 PM] fancy: go ahead
[8:05 PM] A Random Badger: so what have you learned @pizza
[8:05 PM] fancy: OOF
[8:05 PM] fancy: phrasing lmfao
[8:06 PM] pizza: wtf badger is this detention
[8:06 PM] A Random Badger: english is not my first language okay
[8:06 PM] A Random Badger: yes
[8:06 PM] A Random Badger: what have you learned today
[8:06 PM] pizza: i see how it was rude, i see how it was interpreted
[8:07 PM] A Random Badger: and?
[8:08 PM] pizza: and while i still disagree with some of the stuff said here, i'm working on not doing that stuff and being rude to people
[8:08 PM] pizza: i do want ot play poker and i'm more than willing to give SH another shot
[8:08 PM] pizza: I talked to a friend at work about SH for like an hour today
[8:08 PM] A Random Badger: and how do you plan on not being rude anymore?
[8:08 PM] fancy: oh god badger ur hurting me pls
[8:09 PM] pizza: by being more committed to actually paying attention and not getting occupied in other stuff also yeah badger this hurts
[8:09 PM] A Random Badger: and if you find yourself losing interest?
[8:09 PM] fancy: BADGER
[8:09 PM] pizza: jeuss christ
[8:09 PM] fancy: PERFORMANCE REVIEW
[8:09 PM] fancy: NOW
[8:09 PM] fancy: I'm docking your pay.
[8:09 PM] A Random Badger: pizza has to learn his lesson
[8:09 PM] fancy: this is two strikes
[8:09 PM] fancy: one more and ur fired
[8:09 PM] A Random Badger: he hasnt learned it yet until he's proved it to me
[8:10 PM] fancy: ANYWAY
[8:10 PM] A Random Badger: and he's missing 1 key detail
[8:10 PM] fancy: getting out of principal mode
[8:10 PM] A Random Badger: 1 very key detail
[8:10 PM] A Random Badger: what is it @pizza ?
[8:10 PM] pizza: communication?
[8:10 PM] A Random Badger: yes
8:10 PM] pizza: didn't we already estalblish
[8:10 PM] pizza: that it doesn't matter
[8:10 PM] pizza: bc it's rude to do it anyways
[8:10 PM] fancy: yes he doesn't say he's sorry and he just dodges it cus he thinks saying he understands is the same as an apology
[8:10 PM] pizza: like the difference btween shitting on a car and saying you're gonna do it before doing it
[8:11 PM] pizza: wait what didn't i apologize many times
[8:11 PM] fancy: that's also part of why I'm upset
[8:11 PM] fancy: no
[8:11 PM] A Random Badger: you're assignment is to watch the spongebob episode about assertiveness 5 times a day for the next week as training to be more assertive and vocal about your feelings
[8:11 PM] A Random Badger: @pizza
[8:11 PM] pizza: wait no hold on
[8:11 PM] fancy: last night you 100% made it worse
[8:11 PM] fancy: with what you said
[8:11 PM] fancy: it was worse than just saying nothing
[8:11 PM] A Random Badger: who said what last night
[8:12 PM] A Random Badger: explain yourselves

Spongebob Beep! Beep!

[8:13 PM] A Random Badger: @pizza
[8:13 PM] A Random Badger: watch
[8:13 PM] A Random Badger: many times
[8:13 PM] A Random Badger: until you've learned
[8:13 PM] pizza: as if i haven't seen this episode multple times already
[8:13 PM] A Random Badger: you obviously learned nothing from it then
[8:14 PM] A Random Badger: oof
[8:14 PM] pizza: wait so wym i haven't apologized
[8:14 PM] A Random Badger: that was a really cringy attempt at an apology pizza
[8:14 PM] A Random Badger: your new assignment is to apologize again here
[8:14 PM] A Random Badger: in front of me as witness
[8:14 PM] pizza: what no not in steam
8:14 PM] fancy: so whatever you said last night was like
[8:14 PM] pizza: i apologized today
[8:14 PM] fancy: all sorts of bad
[8:15 PM] A Random Badger: i agree
[8:15 PM] A Random Badger: that conversation was
[8:15 PM] A Random Badger: pretty bad
[8:15 PM] pizza: i texted a couple hours ago
[8:15 PM] A Random Badger: real oof
[8:15 PM] pizza: "I'm sorry about last night"
[8:15 PM] A Random Badger: okay fair enough
[8:15 PM] fancy: yeah and then we go on to find out u still disagree
[8:15 PM] fancy: so like
[8:15 PM] fancy: I'm not inspired with confidence
[8:15 PM] fancy: so my most logical move is to continue with original plan
[8:16 PM] fancy: which is return to the 7 years of wanting to play tabletop
[8:16 PM] pizza: and if I apologized becasue I truly regretted the way I acted yesterday and don't want to do that to you again, you wouldn't assume it's just an attempt to appease you until the next time this happens?
[8:16 PM] pizza: because any other times i've apologized for things, that's generally what you say you think it is
[8:16 PM] pizza: because if that's what you want then
[8:16 PM] pizza: I am sorry
[8:16 PM] pizza: I was an ass
[8:16 PM] A Random Badger: hold on pause
[8:16 PM] A Random Badger: pizza
[8:16 PM] pizza: I still don't agree with everything we discussed here but that's not going to make me not feel bad
[8:17 PM] pizza: or not bad for what I did
[8:17 PM] fancy: so I can explain
[8:17 PM] A Random Badger: do you understand in this specific circumstance why he felt like you didn't really care about his feelings regarding the messages exchanged last night?
[8:17 PM] fancy: with a good example from last night
[8:17 PM] fancy: well badger you're missing it
[8:17 PM] A Random Badger: go ahead then
[8:17 PM] fancy: he disgrees with my perception of what happened which means it is more likely to happen again
[8:18 PM] fancy: at least that's what I understand right now
[8:18 PM] fancy: unless he wants to be more specific about what he disagrees with
[8:18 PM] fancy: cus like
[8:18 PM] fancy: saying
[8:18 PM] fancy: "okay I understand but I still disagree with some of it but I'll be better"
8:18 PM] A Random Badger: understandable
[8:18 PM] fancy: is a very vacuous statement
[8:18 PM] fancy: cus it's so vague
[8:18 PM] A Random Badger: then lets explore that
[8:18 PM] fancy: and reeks of
[8:18 PM] fancy: I'm tired of this pls done now
[8:18 PM] A Random Badger: pizza pls elaborate
[8:19 PM] A Random Badger: what you disagree with
[8:23 PM] pizza: hold on sorry my parents walked in to measure my room for some reason
[8:24 PM] A Random Badger: all good
[8:34 PM] fancy: I can discord now I'm still at work tho
[8:35 PM] fancy: it's after hours so I can argue unrestricted xd
[8:35 PM] pizza: i think the only thing i disagree with is what I did being wildly worse than what julian and yoshi did, but it's not my job to apologize for them or hold them accountable. I can only apologize for myself. I don't know if disagreeing on the extent of rudeness relative to other people's actions constitutes a dismissal of my apology, but I also understand the hesitation to accept it
[8:35 PM] pizza: i can hop on if you want, gotta boot the pc
[8:35 PM] pizza: i won't be doing ranked dota so there's that xd
[8:35 PM] pizza: gimme a minute
[8:36 PM] fancy: so
[8:36 PM] fancy: I have a question
[8:36 PM] fancy: do you think what they did was worse than I think it is?
[8:36 PM] fancy: or do you think that what you did wasn't as bad as I think it was?
[8:37 PM] pizza: the first
8:37 PM] fancy: why do you think what they did was bad
[8:37 PM] pizza: because it was basically sabotaging the game and throwing only to ditch sooner
[8:38 PM] fancy: I don't think changing their mind and deciding to not play is that bad
[8:38 PM] A Random Badger: im only in here waiting for people to play games xd
[8:38 PM] fancy: plus it's play money it's never going to be that serious
[8:39 PM] fancy: like horrible ass bets happen all the time
[8:39 PM] fancy: and play is super abnormal
[8:39 PM] fancy: no matter what with play money
[8:39 PM] fancy: ask nikki
[8:39 PM] fancy: there's no consequences
[8:39 PM] fancy: I mean in the first night you threw away 9k
[8:41 PM] pizza: does intention not matter? I would try to participate more becuase i wanted to learn the game and how it played. Harder to do that if i fold my hand as many times as a serious player probably should.
[8:41 PM] pizza: also it's probably worth acknowledging that i've never played poker andi'm terrible
[8:41 PM] pizza: which could also very well be an explanation for losing money
[8:41 PM] pizza: a contributing factor for sure
[8:41 PM] pizza: it's nto like i never folded
[8:41 PM] pizza: one time i literaly thought that my trick was better than badgers bc i forgot the ranking lol
