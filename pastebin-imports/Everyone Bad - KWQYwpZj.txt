[9:00 PM] fancy: does that make it not murder?
[9:00 PM] fancy: so fuckign disappointed I stayed up to play games at all ever
[9:00 PM] fancy: I'm joining the magia
[9:00 PM] fancy: mafia
[9:01 PM] Suck it, Moto!: See she'd actually be worth the stool if she didnt talk so much @Subhanshu
[9:01 PM] Suck it, Moto!: She is actually hot
[9:01 PM] Suck it, Moto!: We will still game but not to the insane frequency we have been the past few weeks
[9:02 PM] fancy: the ability
[9:02 PM] fancy: to miss the point
[9:02 PM] fancy: is astounding
[9:02 PM] fancy: I wonder if
[9:02 PM] fancy: I'm even having the same conversation as the other person sometimes
[9:02 PM] fancy: when do I get an invite to that world
[9:04 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I dont understand. You regret everything ever?
[9:05 PM] fancy: I regret the amount of puss
[9:05 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Explain my puss
[9:06 PM] fancy: do you really want me to
[9:06 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Yes
[9:07 PM] fancy: I believe it unwise
[9:07 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I believe in honesty
[9:07 PM] fancy: no you don't
[9:07 PM] fancy: because you had such an issue
[9:08 PM] fancy: with the problem I have with frats
[9:08 PM] fancy: and you took it extremely personally for no reason
[9:09 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Im sorry if i took it personally then. I consider it resolved now though, that I am okay with their practices and you are not.
[9:10 PM] fancy: it is what it is
[9:13 PM] Suck it, Moto!: is my puss that i bailed on csgo go this afternoon for sleep?
[9:13 PM] fancy: sorta
[9:13 PM] fancy: it's more complicated than that
[9:13 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Okay. Im happy to talk about it if you want
[9:14 PM] fancy: It's probably more of a problem on my end because I have certain expectations which could be considered foolish(edited)
[9:16 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Like you expect more availability?
[9:17 PM] fancy: has less to do with that
[9:17 PM] fancy: it's a compilation(edited)
[9:17 PM] fancy: of things that I classify as puss
[9:17 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Which are?
[9:17 PM] fancy: like I said, it's unwise I believe
[9:19 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Well now im just curious
[9:19 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Out with it!
[9:20 PM] Coeurdleon: i appear t o have come in at a bad time?
[9:29 PM] fancy: depends
[9:29 PM] fancy: are you a puss
[9:34 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Josh is mad at me about something but wont tell me
[9:35 PM] fancy: I'm not mad per se
[9:35 PM] fancy: idk the right word
[9:35 PM] fancy: there's just so much puss in everyone forever(edited)
[9:35 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Are you afraid I'll get angry or something
[9:36 PM] fancy: I'm pretty sure that it would be unwise to list all my complaints
[9:36 PM] fancy: most people are really bad at handling things like that
[9:36 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Josh, I'm not like most girls
[9:37 PM] fancy: people fam
[9:37 PM] fancy: people
[7:16 AM] Subhanshu: Quality convos
[10:18 AM] fancy: Quality puss more like it
[11:53 AM] Subhanshu: mmm some quality poon
[11:53 AM] fancy: Uh huh
[11:53 AM] fancy: Sure
[11:53 AM] fancy: Go with that
[11:55 AM] fancy: Ignoring things through comedy always makes things better!
[11:55 AM] fancy: Promise.
[11:55 AM] Subhanshu: didn't you conclude that you weren't gonna explain yourself anyways
[11:56 AM] Subhanshu: i wasn't even part of that conversation so i don't get why it's my responsibility to reciprocate
[11:59 AM] fancy: Well
[11:59 AM] fancy: The original comment was also directed at you
[11:59 AM] fancy: And then you kinda inserted yourself into the conversation
[12:00 PM] Subhanshu: the conversation looked like it ended
[12:00 PM] fancy: I concluded that its unwise for me to explain because people are going to get super offended because that's how they do and it won't help anything
[12:00 PM] fancy: Such is life
[12:00 PM] Subhanshu: yeah, it concluded
[12:00 PM] fancy: Doesn't mean I wish I could explain
[12:00 PM] Subhanshu: quality convos about puss and basements and mics
[12:00 PM] fancy: And doesn't mean there's not a problem
[12:01 PM] fancy: So
[12:01 PM] Subhanshu: if you have a problem and aren't willing to say it then don't expect anything to change
[12:01 PM] fancy: I never expect anyone to change
[12:01 PM] fancy: No one does
[12:01 PM] fancy: Oh well
[12:01 PM] fancy: Naught to be done for that
[12:02 PM] fancy: But just because stark can't remove the shrapnel from his heart doesn't mean it's not killing him
[12:02 PM] Subhanshu: i think you missed the part where he removed the shrapnel from his heart
[12:03 PM] fancy: Yeah after he spent a ton of time figuring it out
[12:03 PM] fancy: So once people figure out how to not take everything personally
[12:03 PM] fancy: Then I can explain how I'm disappointed by everyone
[12:03 PM] fancy: But until then it won't help
[12:03 PM] fancy: It'll just make everyone upset
[12:03 PM] Subhanshu: actually according to canon, it was a really simple procedure, pretty conventional. it just took him a long time to decide to remove it.
[12:04 PM] fancy: It's really pretty simple to not take things personally
[12:04 PM] fancy: So don't
[12:05 PM] fancy: Same principle if you want to go there
[12:05 PM] Subhanshu: i don't understand what about tony stark was to be taken personally
[12:06 PM] fancy: ?
[12:06 PM] fancy: It's the principle
[12:06 PM] fancy: It's an analogy
[12:08 PM] fancy: I can't explain myself because people take things personally, yet its simple for them to just see the big picture and not take it so
[12:08 PM] fancy: Likewise, stark couldn't not be dying because his heart was full of metal, yet it was a simple procedure to remove it
[12:08 PM] fancy: But until the metal is removed, he can't not be dying
[12:08 PM] fancy: Etc
[12:14 PM] Subhanshu: well if you're gonna mention that you have serious issues with people to their face and then not tell them because you don't think they can handle it, then it's better to not mention it at all. Everyoen has shortcomings. We all have problems with you, or julian, or andrew, or whoever. they're either significant enough to bring up to the person, or they're not significant enough to really be a problem and you deal with it. If you feel like saying "oh yeah btw you all do this thing I hate and it really bothers me and gets on my nerves and ruins my day but I'm not going to tell you" then what's the point of mentioning it in the first place?  People always change. You've changed, I've changed, everyone changes. We all have problems with you, just like you all have problems with me. But they're either somethign you bring up because it affects you that much, or they're not significant enough to ask for me to change. Make up your mind.
[1:28 PM] fancy: People don't change
[1:29 PM] fancy: I'm still the same person I was. Circumstances change, people don't.
[1:31 PM] fancy: There's more options than just significant or not significant because of how people react. There are things that are significant enough that I would like to be different, but there's no point in explaining them all because people are just going to get upset and people who are upset don't accept criticism.
[1:32 PM] fancy: Just because there's an emotional reaction on my end to something doesn't mean it can or should be explained.
[1:32 PM] fancy: It's like how I find things like "Canada: America's Hat" to be hilarious and other people don't
[1:33 PM] fancy: I can kinda explain why I think it's funny but it doesn't really make the other person understand
[1:33 PM] fancy: Yet we can both still acknowledge that I find it funny.
[1:36 PM] fancy: But it's okay because my opinion doesn't count because I think about things wrong or I'm too smart or I just don't understand etc
[1:36 PM] fancy: Such is life
[7:06 PM] Suck it, Moto!: @fancy I do think people change.
[7:08 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I would rather talk about the problems you're experiencing with me than just ignore them knowing they are there. I promise not ot take it personally.
[7:12 PM] fancy: The problem with that is everyone ALWAYS says they won't take it personally
[7:12 PM] fancy: And yet, here we are
[7:12 PM] fancy: It's one of those things people say because it's what they'd like to believe
[7:13 PM] fancy: Sorta like "I'd never be like that" "I'd never do xyz" " I don't understand why anyone could do xyz"
[7:15 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Well now that I know you have a problem with me it's gonna bother me that I dont know what it is and I cant try and fix it/make it better for you
[7:16 PM] Suck it, Moto!: is it something Im doing that is directly affecting you or is it something about me that you dont care for?
[7:17 PM] fancy: I'm not sure they're even things that should change just to convenience me.
[7:17 PM] fancy: Like I said, it's very possible my expectations are conditioned by previous experiences
[7:17 PM] fancy: And who am I to tell you how to live anyway
[7:18 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I think you have a right to give me advice on how to live, yes. you're my friend, your opinion matters to me
[7:19 PM] fancy: I think the greatest extent of my input gets to be to express my feelings about things people do
[7:19 PM] fancy: But even then it's dangerously close to telling them how I want them to be
[7:20 PM] fancy: Which I think is wrong
[7:20 PM] fancy: Because it's not like my opinion is even entirely accurate
[7:20 PM] Suck it, Moto!: i dont think that's wrong. you can absolutley tell me what to do, but i wont necessarily always follow your advice
[7:20 PM] fancy: Even most of the time
[7:21 PM] Suck it, Moto!: either way though I do appreciate your input
[7:21 PM] fancy: I disagree because even if we follow that line
[7:21 PM] fancy: The act of me expressing it still affects people
[7:21 PM] fancy: Even if they're like psh fuck that
[7:21 PM] fancy: It still affects it somewhat
[7:21 PM] fancy: Which isn't my place
[7:22 PM] fancy: Like if it's something you'd be on the fence about, and my opinion pushed you over
[7:22 PM] fancy: I don't think that's right of me
[7:23 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Even if there zero chance i'll do what you say, I still appreciate you giving your opinion because it gives  another set of alternatives to acknowledge and think about, which may indirectly lead to a better decision
[7:24 PM] Suck it, Moto!: You dont give yourself enough credit Josh, We are good enough friends that you can give me advice/criticism and our relationship wont be threathened by it.
[7:24 PM] fancy: While true, there's also the drawback of upsetting people
[7:24 PM] fancy: See you say that, yet past experience says otherwise
[7:25 PM] fancy: Which is why I hesitate
[7:25 PM] Suck it, Moto!: your past experiences with other people or me specifically?
[7:25 PM] fancy: Both
[7:25 PM] Subhanshu: Then why mention that you have problems and don't think he can take it even if he's insisting, begging in fact, for you to tell him
[7:25 PM] fancy: He dug for it
[7:25 PM] fancy: All I said is omg I'm gonna kms so much puss
[7:25 PM] fancy: Or something along those lines
[7:26 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I got heated when we talked about fraternities but I dont think that shook up our friendship at all
[7:26 PM] fancy: That doesn't mean people weren't upset lol
[7:27 PM] fancy: Even if it passes you can't say that it was a positive experience
[7:27 PM] fancy: Why induce more of that
[7:27 PM] Subhanshu: Thus are learning experiences
[7:27 PM] fancy: Except nothing changed after that
[7:27 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I say it was. It improved our firendship because it led me to make adjustments to what i say and now it's not a problem
[7:28 PM] fancy: Nothing really changed though
[7:28 PM] fancy: Even if you don't talk about it
[7:28 PM] fancy: It's still a thing
[7:28 PM] Subhanshu: We learned about each other
[7:28 PM] Subhanshu: And about frats
[7:28 PM] fancy: It makes no difference if you shove it in my face or not
[7:28 PM] fancy: Well, I should rephrase
[7:28 PM] fancy: It makes no difference if you bring it up casually because you're telling a story or something
[7:29 PM] fancy: Or if you never bring it up at all
[7:29 PM] fancy: The facts don't change
[7:30 PM] fancy: And yeah, I learned that you, like most people, in the heat of passion, can't differentiate yourself from the things you do and things you take part in
[7:30 PM] fancy: I.E. Taking it personally
[7:30 PM] fancy: Which is fine and expected and typical
[7:30 PM] Suck it, Moto!: So you don't believe me when I say I promise not take it personally?
[7:31 PM] fancy: It's where pride and patriotism come from
[7:31 PM] fancy: No I don't
[7:31 PM] fancy: I believe you want to not
[7:31 PM] fancy: But I don't believe you can or will
[7:34 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Okay. I'd say our conversation that started yesterday and up until now is a pretty clear preface to one about the problems you're concerned/annoyed with, so Im very warmed up to the idea that you have an issue you'd like to discuss. so it wont come as a big shock to me now if we talk about it
[7:34 PM] fancy: And I may be wrong or I may be right, but considering all the data I have, it's the most prudent line
[7:34 PM] Suck it, Moto!: i believe we could work it out
[7:34 PM] fancy: I believe that's possible, probable even
[7:34 PM] fancy: I also believe it's very likely people will get upset
[7:34 PM] fancy: Considering everything and that you're not the only one involved
[7:34 PM] fancy: So
[7:35 PM] fancy: The numbers I have are what I have to work with basically
[7:35 PM] fancy: I'm tired and worn out and don't want to do damage control
[7:35 PM] fancy: Because this time of year sucks fucking ass enough already
[7:41 PM] Suck it, Moto!: i think we should talk about it
[7:41 PM] Suck it, Moto!: it can be just you and me if that's better
[7:44 PM] fancy: Talk about what
[7:44 PM] fancy: I also said I'm not even sure if I'm right
[7:45 PM] fancy: And I rarely ever argue about something if I'm not sure I'm right
[7:45 PM] Suck it, Moto!: it's okay if you're not sure, I wont hold it against you
[7:45 PM] Suck it, Moto!: thats not my style
[7:47 PM] fancy: it's not something I do for other people lol
[7:47 PM] fancy: I just don't see any reason to talk about somethign I'm not sure about
[7:47 PM] fancy: unless I'm asking about it
[7:47 PM] fancy: but I'm not asking you what I'm feeling
[7:47 PM] fancy: that makes no sense
[7:47 PM] fancy: that's like asking the moon if the rocks are going to be hard today
[7:49 PM] Suck it, Moto!: even if you're not sure about it, it is bothering you and Id rather discuss it and find a way to put it behind us. or at least just acknowledge it and move on it if cant be helped
[7:49 PM] Suck it, Moto!: like
[7:50 PM] Suck it, Moto!: at this point i feel like Im gonna be more bothered by not knowing than whatever it might be
[7:50 PM] fancy: Adnrew there are a million and one things bothering me
[7:50 PM] fancy: I'm always going to be bothered
[7:50 PM] fancy: it's my life
[7:50 PM] fancy: it's anyone's life
[7:50 PM] fancy: it's how life do
[7:52 PM] Suck it, Moto!: doesnt mean you can talk to your friend about it
[7:53 PM] Suck it, Moto!: being bothered about 1 million things is still better than 1million and one
[7:54 PM] fancy: by numbers yes, effectively not so much
[7:54 PM] fancy: losing one drop of water out of the ocean is a lot less severe than losing one drop when you have 3(edited)
