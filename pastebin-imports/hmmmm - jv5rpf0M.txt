Pizza:
	also what is this inferior triple dagger talent you keep getting :thinking:

[1:29 AM]
Johnny 99:
	???
	I think it's shit

[1:29 AM]
Pizza:
	:thonking:

[1:29 AM]
Johnny 99:
	ok

[1:29 AM]
Pizza:
	why keep getting shit talent

[1:30 AM]
Johnny 99:
	bcus I literally copy builds

[1:30 AM]
Pizza:
	why do you think pros get shitty talent

[1:30 AM]
Johnny 99:
	they probably know more than I do

[1:31 AM]
Pizza:
	hmm

[1:32 AM]
Johnny 99:
	doesn't change my opinion

[1:35 AM]
Pizza:
	just changes what you skill every game lol

[1:35 AM]
Johnny 99:
	?
	I copy builds
	it's what I do

[1:36 AM]
Pizza:
	copy builds you think you could make better hmm

[1:36 AM]
Johnny 99:
	uh no?
	what
	ok

[1:37 AM]
Pizza:
	if you think is shit talent, why not change everything about build but talent choice

[1:37 AM]
Johnny 99:
	cus they're rank 10 and I'm not?

[1:37 AM]
Pizza:
	if you still think it's a shit talent even though pros are getting it all the time, do you not think that maybe you're wrong about it being shit?

[1:37 AM]
Johnny 99:
	no I think it's a shit talent
	I think rng is bad to rely on
	like u could change it to be 200 daggers
	and I would think it's shit
	cus I don't like things that have a chance to do nothing
	like that's horrible

[1:43 AM]
Pizza:
	Idk just think it’s weird you’re skilling it
	Seems against your normal standards of actually thinking about builds

[1:44 AM]
Johnny 99:
	what

[1:44 AM]
Pizza:
	Rather than just copying even if you disagree
	Just seems weird

[1:45 AM]
Johnny 99:
	I think just going to dotabuff.com and clicking on resolution and then building those items is better than reinventing the wheel
	my standards are whatever the good players tell me to do
	i wouldn't copy a rank 1k player

[1:46 AM]
Pizza:
	Still seems against what you’re normally about

[1:46 AM]
Johnny 99:
	idk this seems pretty consistent

[1:46 AM]
Pizza:
	It’s not thinking

[1:46 AM]
Johnny 99:
	I don't see that
	what do you mean it's not thinking
	why on earth would I think I have thought of something that top players haven't
	that's delusional lol

[1:48 AM]
Pizza:
	Seems way shallower than your normal strategic investment into dota

[1:48 AM]
Johnny 99:
	uhhh
	ok
	I disagree
	I don't think I've ever implied you should try to think better than top 10 players
	lol

[1:51 AM]
Pizza:
	I still don’t get this “pro players get dagger because they must know something about it being better that I don’t, but I’m still going to think it’s worse instead of just saying that I must be wrong and not know why”

[1:51 AM]
Johnny 99:
	cus the reason it's good is a bad reason
	randomly critting/bashing/cleaving ppl
	is bad
	I don't like random chances to win the game with no downsides
	it's bad

[1:52 AM]
Pizza:
	Bad on what scale? For what’s effective?

[1:52 AM]
Johnny 99:
	both

[1:52 AM]
Pizza:
	Okay but

[1:52 AM]
Johnny 99:
	I don't think relying on chance based things is a good idea
	I dont' like chance based mechanics are good

[1:52 AM]
Pizza:
	Saying it’s bad for game design reasons is different than saying it’s objectively less effective

[1:52 AM]
Johnny 99:
	I don't think*
	it's more effective over 1k games
	it's sometimes less and sometiems more effective in an individual game
	so I think it's bad
	no one has refuted that
	ppl take the talent and they make items

[1:53 AM]
Pizza:
	I mean PA is a very chance based hero and she’s apparently good

[1:53 AM]
Johnny 99:
	she's good because all her numbers and items were buffed
	and then she was reworked

[1:54 AM]
Pizza:
	Like yeah blur change pushed her into meta but she’s still chance based

[1:54 AM]
Johnny 99:
	cus she's been bad since 5 years
	or something
	and yeah I think pa is a bad hero lol
	like if you don't crit you just lose

[1:54 AM]
Pizza:
	What kind of bad

[1:54 AM]
Johnny 99:
	and if you do crit you win
	that's just bad
	that's way less reliable than i want it to be
	it's just the upside is so fucking high people pick it anyway
	but I don't value that
	I think it's bad
	but I don't argue with ppl that know more than I do
	I just do what they tell me to

[1:57 AM]
Pizza:
	So when pros thought meepo was op in their pubs you still argued with that, right?

[1:57 AM]
Johnny 99:
	No I argued with u
	cus ur reasons were shit
	lol

[1:58 AM]
Pizza:
	But your point wasn’t “yeah he’s op but not for those reasons”
	Your view was that he was totally fine

[1:58 AM]
Johnny 99:
	I didn't think he was
	based on the changes

[1:58 AM]
Pizza:
	iirc

[1:58 AM]
Johnny 99:
	they seemed to make him a lot weaker
	cus I didn't consider a lot of stuff
	that interacted with his hero
	but if ink
	had said
	"meepo is busted"
	I would have been like
	ok
	but u are not ink
	u don't even play meepo
	and u didn't cite anyone that's really good at meepo

[1:59 AM]
Pizza:
	that’s like saying you can’t judge a meal and its tastiness because I can’t cook it
	Pros complaining about it and a near 70% winrate should be enough lol

[2:00 AM]
Johnny 99:
	no it's not
	that's not the same at all

[2:00 AM]
Pizza:
	Yeah it kinda is

[2:00 AM]
Johnny 99:
	this is like complaining about a meal cus ur friend tried it and said it was bad

[2:00 AM]
Pizza:
	Just because i don’t spam hero doesn’t mean I can’t understand what makes it busted

[2:00 AM]
Johnny 99:
	u don't actually know
	Okay well if u understood
	then u are bad at speaking
	lol
	cus none of the reasons you presented
	were what I found when I went to find the opinions of meepo players
	but there is no reason for me to trust the opinion of someone that doesn't play a hero and presents no sources that would be more knowledgable, and also presents reasons that are unconvincing
	like, taking that opinion seriously would be insane
	imo
	but if reso makes treads 3 wraith bands deso and bkb and takes the same talents I'm gonna take that seriously
	i don't see how these two things are teh same at all
	plus you're the one that told me you didn't want to take yoshi's opinion seriously because "he's not even good"
	if anyone isn't being consistent, it's you lol

[2:04 AM]
Pizza:
	I think that there’s significant value lost in simply copying something because better players do it. I think you both very frequently just regurgitate stuff you hear and eee
	Without thinking why it is the way it is

[2:04 AM]
Johnny 99:
	I don't understand this sentiment
	are you saying I don't understand dota as well as the ppl that have 8800 mmr?
	because yes
	that is true
	half the reasons things happen in this game I probably don't understand

[2:05 AM]
Pizza:
	Twhile true, that’s not what I’m saying

[2:05 AM]
Johnny 99:
	I'm not good
	My opinion doesn't matter lol
	I'm not a dota expert
	I just copy the people that are

[2:06 AM]
Pizza:
	I don’t think you believe that lol

[2:06 AM]
Johnny 99:
	I mean
	ok
	you are free to think that
	but I don't see how you go from "you just regurgitate what people say without thinking about it" to "you think you know everything"
	why do you think I get really excited when I hear something from a pro that validates something I thought
	like if it happened all the time then I wouldn't get excited
	but it doesn't lol
	you seem to think that since i have confidence in my opinions I don' tthink they can be wrong
	but those aren't the same thing
	I'm wrong a lot
	I make the wrong items and I make bad plays
	and I'm in the wrong places
	and etc
	but that doesn' tmean I'm not going to be confident about the decisions I make

[2:16 AM]
Pizza:
	It just seems weird to me, to be confident in your decisions and their reasoning but then just copy builds because good people do them
	It seems conflicting somehow

[2:16 AM]
Johnny 99:
	I don't see how that conflicts itself
	you'd have to explain

[2:16 AM]
Pizza:
	Tomorrow if time permits
