[4:02 PM] Raccoon Friend: Guys Kung Fu Panda might be the best animated movie in existence
[4:02 PM] Raccoon Friend: deb8 me
[4:04 PM] 공상: Fantasia exists
[4:05 PM] 공상: Fantasia is definitely better than Kung Fu Panda
[4:05 PM] 공상: therefore , KFP can't be the best
[4:06 PM] 공상: @Raccoon Friend
[4:07 PM] pizza: Toy Story
[4:07 PM] pizza: drops mic
[4:09 PM] 공상: idk if toy story is better than Fantasia
[4:09 PM] pizza: Yes. Any of them
[4:09 PM] 공상: uhhhh
[4:09 PM] 공상: I disagree
[4:10 PM] pizza: Fantasia is great
[4:10 PM] pizza: It was super ambitious and it deliver d
[4:10 PM] pizza: *delivered
[4:13 PM] 공상: there's also inside out
[4:13 PM] 공상: which was also really well done
[4:38 PM] Raccoon Friend: Never seen it
[4:39 PM] Raccoon Friend: what has the world come to
[4:40 PM] Raccoon Friend: Is fantasia really a movie though?
[4:41 PM] Raccoon Friend: it's more like a collection of music with visual accompaniment
[4:42 PM] Raccoon Friend: Toy story 2 is the best toy story
[4:42 PM] pizza: ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[4:42 PM] pizza: i honestly think 2 is hte worst
[4:42 PM] pizza: granted it's the worst out of three amazing movies
[4:42 PM] pizza: but i'm not a fan of toy story 2
[4:42 PM] pizza: like it's emotional and deals with some heartwrenching issues
[4:43 PM] 공상: yes like not growing up
[4:43 PM] 공상: xd
[4:43 PM] pizza: not really
[4:43 PM] Raccoon Friend: Toy story can't put a candle to KFP's comedy though
[4:44 PM] 공상: idk I respect that everyone think toy story is a good movie but I don't see it
[4:44 PM] pizza: yeah neither can Schindler's list
[4:44 PM] pizza: or shawshank redemption
[4:44 PM] Raccoon Friend: Animated children's movies have to comedy elements
[4:44 PM] Raccoon Friend: some focus on it more
[4:44 PM] pizza: you're saying they have ot have comedy elements?
[4:44 PM] pizza: says who?
[4:44 PM] Raccoon Friend: but it's a part of the genre
[4:45 PM] 공상: I disagree
[4:45 PM] pizza: animation is just a means to create a world
[4:45 PM] pizza: it doesn't have to me comedic
[4:45 PM] pizza: even slightly
[4:45 PM] 공상: Coraline was animated but I don't think it was comedic iirc
[4:45 PM] 공상: I never saw it tho
[4:45 PM] 공상: I only know it was dark or something
[4:45 PM] Raccoon Friend: Even The Iron Giant is funny
[4:45 PM] pizza: i mean sure
[4:45 PM] pizza: movies have comedic moments
[4:45 PM] pizza: i wouldn't call the iron giant a "funny"movie
[4:46 PM] Raccoon Friend: it's not
[4:46 PM] pizza: the lion king's not a "funny movie" even if the timon and pumba stuff is pretty funny
[4:46 PM] Raccoon Friend: but since it's animation and targets kids is has to have moments of comedic relief
[4:46 PM] Raccoon Friend: it's child pyscology or something(edited)
[4:46 PM] pizza: not all movies have to be targeted at kids though
[4:46 PM] pizza: it's not part of the requirements of a good movie
[4:47 PM] Raccoon Friend: It is for animation, in almost all cases
[4:47 PM] 공상: I also don't think that's what targets kids
[4:47 PM] 공상: the requirement for targeting kids is having a level they can follow
[4:47 PM] pizza: ^^
[4:47 PM] 공상: good animated movies have kid level stuff and adult level stuff usually
[4:47 PM] Raccoon Friend: KFP is a fantastic movie and has everything
[4:47 PM] Raccoon Friend: all im saying
[4:48 PM] pizza: yeah it's a really great, underrated movie
[4:48 PM] pizza: it's got heart, it's got beautiful animation
[4:48 PM] pizza: it's got great voice acting
[4:48 PM] pizza: but it was nowhere near as revolutionary as toy story
[4:48 PM] pizza: or even fantasia
[4:48 PM] Raccoon Friend: It was one of the first martial arts animations that accurately represents the art it's portraying
[4:49 PM] 공상: imo it's also really surface
[4:49 PM] 공상: I hated the message of kfp
[4:49 PM] pizza: "there is no secret ingredient"
[4:49 PM] pizza: eh i don't hate it
[4:49 PM] pizza: i really like it actually
[4:49 PM] Raccoon Friend: it's a great message
[4:49 PM] 공상: I disagree with it
[4:49 PM] pizza: it's a cool awesome movie, but it is still pretty shallow
[4:49 PM] 공상: heavily
[4:49 PM] pizza: and generic
[4:49 PM] 공상: because they make it out like this whole big thing
[4:49 PM] pizza: liek the message of toy story 2 is like fucking
[4:49 PM] pizza: all good thigns come to an end
[4:49 PM] pizza: and like
[4:49 PM] pizza: woody has to choose between being immortalized and living forever
[4:49 PM] 공상: and then they're just like it's u ur the special snowflake believe in urself and follow ur dreams
[4:49 PM] pizza: and respected and kept clean
[4:49 PM] 공상: I hate that message
[4:49 PM] Raccoon Friend: Why is it shallow?
[4:49 PM] pizza: or to spend a few years with the kid he loves
[4:50 PM] pizza: like that's fucking
[4:50 PM] pizza: i'm getting chills just talking about the message in toy story 2
[4:50 PM] Raccoon Friend: You hate the message because you don't believe in it
[4:50 PM] Raccoon Friend: ?
[4:50 PM] pizza: i mean i don't necessarily believe in kfp message and i like that movie
[4:50 PM] pizza: and the message
[4:50 PM] 공상: I think its a bad message
[4:50 PM] 공상: I think it's a good movie but it had a really underwhelming message
[4:54 PM] Raccoon Friend: I dont think the message is "follow your dreams ur a special snowflake" it's that "No one is perfect and happiness is a journey not a destination"
[4:54 PM] pizza: what lol
[4:54 PM] pizza: that's not at all the message
[4:55 PM] pizza: they never talk about flaws and shit
[4:55 PM] pizza: no one was seen as perfect in the movie
[4:55 PM] 공상: it's not that I disagree with it in its entirety, but they oversimplified a very nuanced concept to a point where it isn't adding anything helpful
[4:55 PM] pizza: nor was there anything about happiness being a journey
[4:55 PM] pizza: the themes have nothing to do with happiness
[4:55 PM] pizza: the movie's two main things is shifu learning to believe in people/be invested in someone in the way he was invested in tai lung
[4:56 PM] 공상: I also don't think telling kids they can do anything if they believe in themselves and work hard is good
[4:56 PM] 공상: and that's pretty closely related to
[4:56 PM] 공상: there's not special ingredient etc
[4:56 PM] 공상: plus there are special ingredients lol
[4:56 PM] pizza: and then the second is po realizing that he can achieve what he dreams
[4:56 PM] pizza: like
[4:57 PM] pizza: i think fancy and i both agree that hte second message is sort of shallow but still entertaining
[4:57 PM] pizza: but at no point in the movie do they talk about happiness
[4:57 PM] Raccoon Friend: Tai lung is never happy because he believe he is incomplete without the dragon scroll, without his destiny. Po believes for most of the movie that the only way he can save his new friends is to obtain a outside power but when the scroll is blank it shows that Completion, fufillment, and happiness are state's of mind not objectives to be completed. Tai Lung is enraged by the loss of his destiny because he doesn't believe he is worthy without it
[4:58 PM] pizza: but the theme has nothing to do about tai lung's happiness
[4:58 PM] 공상: that feels like a stretch
[4:58 PM] pizza: also po wasn't the one who was striving for the scroll
[4:58 PM] pizza: he believed that he didn't belong and that he didn't deserve the dragon scroll bc he wasn't worthy
4:59 PM] Raccoon Friend: Shifu's arc is about guilt and inner peace not believing in people
[5:01 PM] Raccoon Friend: Tai Lung is portrayed as the perfect warrior that couldnt be defeated by anyone except "the legendary warrior we waited for 1000 years to reveal that can survive on a drop of dew and no food and see the universe in motion around him"(edited)
[5:01 PM] Raccoon Friend: how is that not about perfection
[5:03 PM] Raccoon Friend: Since Uugway has nerve magic he's basically a god. He leaves to show shifu po and the 5 that even though they aren't perfect they still have the power to defeat Tai Lung
[5:05 PM] pizza: Oogway sacrifices himself because he knows that if he doesn't leave, shifu will never take a leap of faith and trust in Po
[5:05 PM] pizza: that's not about being imperfect
[5:05 PM] Raccoon Friend: That too
[5:05 PM] pizza: it's about shifu being unwilling to be invested in any of his students like he was in tai lung
[5:05 PM] pizza: he raised tai lung as his own and he betrayed him
[5:05 PM] pizza: so even the furious five or whatever they're called don't like shifu that much and shifu's a dick to them
[5:05 PM] pizza: because he's afraid to trust and believe
[5:05 PM] Raccoon Friend: He's plenty invested in the 5 just not emotionally available
[5:05 PM] pizza: that's not about being  perfect or imperfect at all
[5:06 PM] pizza: oogway dies so that shifu will learn to trust and believe again
[5:06 PM] pizza: i believe his dying words are "promise me you'll believe"
[5:06 PM] Raccoon Friend: Also Tai Lung's voice actor is fucking amazing
[5:06 PM] pizza: i think everyone did a great job in that movie
[5:06 PM] pizza: jack black included
[5:06 PM] pizza: who i'm not a fan of personally
[5:07 PM] Raccoon Friend: Po is one of the only Jack Black characters that feels like Po and not Jack Black next to a mic(edited)
[5:07 PM] Raccoon Friend: Seth Rogan as mantis is the only mediocre job.
[5:07 PM] pizza: lol jackie chan says like 8 words in the whole movie fun fact
[5:08 PM] Raccoon Friend: Underused but still good
[5:08 PM] pizza: movie also about not caring about what other people think of you

Kung Fu Panda Oogway Comforts Po
[5:08 PM] pizza: this almost sums it up perfectly
[5:08 PM] Raccoon Friend: "Don't noodles"
[5:08 PM] 공상: u guys love murdering trains I have learned
[5:08 PM] pizza: i would like for oogway to narrate my life
[5:09 PM] pizza: the animation in kfp is so nice
[5:09 PM] Raccoon Friend: I think @공상 thinks it's too shallow because the tongue in cheek comedy sometimes whooshes over him(edited)
[5:09 PM] pizza: ehhhhhhhhhh
[5:09 PM] pizza: i think the message is very familiar and very cliche
[5:09 PM] 공상: uh what
[5:09 PM] pizza: and used a lot
[5:09 PM] pizza: "there's no secret ingredient you're special as you are"
[5:09 PM] Raccoon Friend: Yeah you can see all the fur on the animals
[5:09 PM] pizza: that is the message of the movie
[5:10 PM] Raccoon Friend: the particles in the fights are really good
[5:10 PM] 공상: and I think that's a very misleading thing
[5:10 PM] 공상: especially for kids
[5:10 PM] pizza: also it's about inevitability
[5:10 PM] pizza: and how people often run into what they dread the most on their path to run away from it
[5:10 PM] pizza: tai lung only escapes because shifu sends that messenger to double the guards
[5:11 PM] Raccoon Friend: Josh I think you're getting caught up with the idea that the movie tells kids they can do ANYTHING. The movie merely says if you believe in yourself you'll you're capable of more than you might think.
[5:12 PM] Raccoon Friend: A wise master once said "The task is only impossible because you have deemed it so"
[5:12 PM] pizza: All I'm saying is that that's a kinda shallow message, even if it makes for an entertaining movie
[5:12 PM] pizza: that's such a commonly used theme is what i'm saying
[5:12 PM] Raccoon Friend: Why is it shallow?
[5:13 PM] 공상: because like I said
[5:13 PM] 공상: it's very oversimplified
[5:13 PM] 공상: and doesn't really mean anything
[5:13 PM] 공상: also noted that you made this about me again btw lol
[5:13 PM] Raccoon Friend: Because it's too positive and not dark enough? that the theme isn't some morbid tradeoff or something? i dont understand how encouraging children to strive to do more is bad/shallow
[5:14 PM] Raccoon Friend: Well you are known to be nilhistic
[5:14 PM] 공상: it's shallow because it is
5:14 PM] Raccoon Friend: gz
[5:14 PM] 공상: "do your best" is a shallow message
[5:14 PM] Raccoon Friend: that's not the message
[5:15 PM] 공상: that was another example
[5:15 PM] 공상: of a shallow message
[5:15 PM] Raccoon Friend: lol ok
[5:15 PM] 공상: "sometimes you can do more than you thought"
[5:16 PM] 공상: that's not very deep lol
[5:16 PM] Raccoon Friend: define deep then
[5:17 PM] 공상: all good things coming to an end, and having to choose between experiencing them while they're available and appreciating that for what it is, and wasting that time worrying about the inevitable
[5:17 PM] 공상: that's deeper
[5:17 PM] 공상: sometimes sacrificing what you love is the best way to love it is another deeper message
[5:17 PM] 공상: "you're already special wow" is not(edited)
[5:17 PM] Raccoon Friend: "if you love something let it go"
[5:17 PM] 공상: I think that's a shallow portrayal(edited)
[5:18 PM] Raccoon Friend: that is both just as simple and shallow as "Sometime you have to believe in yourself to do something great"
[5:18 PM] 공상: of that message
[5:18 PM] 공상: because it's over simplified
[5:18 PM] Raccoon Friend: IT'S FOR KIDS
[5:18 PM] Raccoon Friend: KIDS ARE DUMB
[5:18 PM] 공상: BUT IM SAYING
[5:18 PM] 공상: that the oversimplified version
[5:18 PM] 공상: of the you are special and can do things
[5:18 PM] 공상: message
[5:19 PM] 공상: I think it's bad
[5:19 PM] 공상: kids also aren't that dumb lol
[5:19 PM] 공상: but my point is
[5:19 PM] 공상: there also isn't anything more
[5:19 PM] 공상: beyond that message
[5:20 PM] Raccoon Friend: Simplicity and profoundness are not mututally exclusive, and Simplicity and shallowness are not synonyms
[5:20 PM] 공상: it's literally just funny
[5:20 PM] Raccoon Friend: very smoll kids see these movies
[5:20 PM] Raccoon Friend: they are dumb
[5:21 PM] 공상: yes but there's no layers
[5:21 PM] 공상: is what I'm saying
[5:21 PM] 공상: it's literally just a shallow message
[5:21 PM] 공상: I'm not saying it's a bad movie
[5:22 PM] 공상: but I think there are lots of movies that are better and do cover more levels of depth
[5:22 PM] 공상: so regardless of my opinion of the benefits and the negatives of the simplified ur special message
[5:22 PM] 공상: I can't find anything in that movie beyond that
[5:22 PM] 공상: wall-e is another movie like that
[5:22 PM] 공상: its message is(edited)
[5:23 PM] 공상: hey take care of ur planet dipshits
[5:23 PM] 공상: also ur bodies
[5:23 PM] 공상: also shallow
[5:24 PM] 공상: so like we can debate the value of telling kids they're already special
[5:25 PM] 공상: but I don't think we'll get anywhere on that one lol
[5:27 PM] Raccoon Friend: Idk how to debate that without things getting too personal
[5:27 PM] 공상: it's rather simple lol
[5:27 PM] 공상: you don't make it about the other person
[5:27 PM] 공상: you deal with arguments and counterarguments
[5:28 PM] 공상: like tell kids they have value(edited)
[5:28 PM] 공상: and they can do things
[5:28 PM] 공상: and they have talent and ability
[5:28 PM] 공상: and encourage them
[5:28 PM] 공상: don't tell them they're special
[5:28 PM] 공상: lol
[5:29 PM] 공상: that kinda strays
[5:29 PM] 공상: but like
[5:29 PM] 공상: i also don't think messages that are strictly positive can be very deep
[5:29 PM] 공상: because it's like, the only response is, well yeah
[5:30 PM] 공상: same with ones that are strictly negative
[5:34 PM] Raccoon Friend: All I was going to say is that, you don't seem to like positive messages and the idea of telling kids they "can do it" in one way or another because you were told the same thing (as we all were) and it didn't live up to your expectations
[5:35 PM] Raccoon Friend: you seem to find more comfort in the idea that not everyone can do it and in fact most people can't do much at all
[5:36 PM] Raccoon Friend: which to me is sad and regrettable
[5:36 PM] Raccoon Friend: but most importantly
[5:36 PM] 공상: But that's the truth
[5:36 PM] 공상: lots more people can't do more things than they can do
[5:37 PM] 공상: I think telling people they can accomplish something is more harmful than encouraging them to try
😫
1
[5:37 PM] Raccoon Friend: But most importantly it doesn't help you
[5:37 PM] 공상: it's results based vs procedure based
[5:38 PM] Raccoon Friend: You think trying and failing feels worse/is worse than not trying and never knowing?
[5:38 PM] 공상: I think it's harmful to instill the expectation in a kid that they "can do it" because it misses the part about accepting that sometimes you can't do it
[5:38 PM] 공상: it's oversimplified to the point of not being useful
[5:38 PM] 공상: like I said
[5:39 PM] 공상: I think failing is better for you if you can cope, but it feels worse
[5:39 PM] Raccoon Friend: If someone doesn't believe they can do someting, like at a core level, they will never do it. Even if in reality they did have the ability to
[5:39 PM] 공상: I don't dislike positive messages
[5:39 PM] 공상: that is also true
[5:40 PM] 공상: that's why this is a very nuanced concept with a lot of depth needed to portray it accurately
[5:40 PM] 공상: and you can just boil it down to "believe in yourself and u can do great things"
[5:40 PM] Raccoon Friend: As kids grow up they are taught they can do anything , and later in development learn that yes people have limits and they will hav eto recognize their own limits
[5:40 PM] 공상: I think that teaching them they can do everything is harmful
[5:41 PM] 공상: for a number of reasons
[5:41 PM] Raccoon Friend: I think it's fine as long they also learn the lessons that limitations do exist. but that's something you teach a older teenager
[5:42 PM] 공상: That's the key part though
[5:42 PM] 공상: where you say
[5:42 PM] 공상: "as long as..."
[5:42 PM] 공상: that's the other necessary part
[5:42 PM] 공상: you don't cut them apart
[5:42 PM] 공상: they come together
[5:42 PM] 공상: that's what would make it a worthwhile message
[5:42 PM] Raccoon Friend: That's the point, you don't learn both those parts at the same time
[5:43 PM] 공상: why not
[5:43 PM] 공상: you most definitely can
[5:43 PM] 공상: or you can teach it in ways
[5:43 PM] 공상: that doesn't make it about the results
[5:44 PM] 공상: which makes it a lot less harmful
[5:44 PM] Raccoon Friend: Kids aren't mature enough to appreciate the nuance of that.
[5:44 PM] 공상: perhaps not but I think it happens earlier than youd think
[5:44 PM] 공상: kids are pretty bright in a lot of ways
[5:45 PM] 공상: but regardless, I think teaching them that they just "can" is setting them up for failure
[5:45 PM] 공상: maybe most people can deal with that
[5:45 PM] Raccoon Friend: If you tell a kid "You can grow up to be anything you want" but at the same time say "But real life will hit you and you'll discover not anything really" it defeats the whole inspiration thing
[5:45 PM] 공상: is it good to inspire someone by lying to them
[5:46 PM] 공상: you don't present it as "you are going to fail cus life sucks"
[5:46 PM] 공상: you encourage them to do things, not to have done things
[5:47 PM] 공상: you encourage them to play hard, work hard, learn, grow, not tell them they are guaranteed to succeed
[5:47 PM] 공상: kids already dream big, don't tell them their dreams will just come true
[5:48 PM] Raccoon Friend: You say you dont think we should tell kids they are special
[5:48 PM] 공상: correct
[5:48 PM] 공상: because that's a lie
[5:48 PM] Raccoon Friend: but kids love being told they'respecial(edited)
[5:48 PM] 공상: so does everyone
[5:48 PM] 공상: everyone loves being flattered
[5:48 PM] 공상: and told nice things
[5:48 PM] 공상: but if it's empty
[5:48 PM] 공상: is that really beneficial
[5:48 PM] Raccoon Friend: Kids are too dumb to tell that it's empty
[5:49 PM] Raccoon Friend: but by the time they realize that
[5:49 PM] 공상: so it's okay to lie because they're dumb?
[5:49 PM] Howdy: :Thinky:
[5:49 PM] Raccoon Friend: hopefully they will also realize it's okay
[5:49 PM] 공상: lol wtf it's not okay
[5:49 PM] 공상: like
[5:49 PM] 공상: you haven't esatblished that
[5:49 PM] 공상: that's what we're discussing
[5:49 PM] 공상: if it's good
[5:49 PM] 공상: and you're like well they'll just hopefully realize that it's okay
[5:50 PM] 공상: which implies it was bad but eh(edited)
[5:50 PM] 공상: kids are dumb so we tell them whatever makes them happy
[5:51 PM] Raccoon Friend: I dont think telling kids that "hey ya know try to do things just know you'll probably not succeed, most people don't. OK gl!"
[5:51 PM] Raccoon Friend: is a better alternative
[5:51 PM] 공상: did I say that's what you should say
[5:51 PM] 공상: you can encourage them without promising their dreams to come true
[5:51 PM] Raccoon Friend: tell them they are not guranteed to succeed
[5:51 PM] 공상: no
[5:51 PM] 공상: I said
[5:52 PM] 공상: don't tell them they're guaranteed to succeed
[5:52 PM] 공상: which is not the same as
[5:52 PM] 공상: tell them they're not guaranteed to succeed
[5:52 PM] Raccoon Friend: It's the same
[5:52 PM] 공상: it is not
[5:53 PM] Raccoon Friend: a kid doesnt know the difference between those two sentences
[5:53 PM] 공상: uh
[5:53 PM] 공상: one isn't even a sentence
[5:53 PM] Raccoon Friend: jkbq wzlxc fdijglhsqb fdsi;ukf.ht
[5:53 PM] 공상: like
[5:53 PM] Raccoon Friend: I quit
[5:53 PM] 공상: one is just saying nothing
[5:53 PM] 공상: one is literally inaction
[5:53 PM] 공상: wtf
[5:53 PM] 공상: "don't do this"
[5:53 PM] 공상: that's literally just
[5:53 PM] 공상: doing anything else
[5:54 PM] 공상: like come on lol
[5:54 PM] 공상: there os a very clear difference between not telling someone something, and telling someone the opposite thing
[5:55 PM] 공상: right now I am not telling you lots of things
[5:55 PM] 공상: such as it's raining
[5:55 PM] Raccoon Friend: Fine become an elementary school teacher and depress the shit outa your kids
[5:55 PM] 공상: sigh
[5:55 PM] 공상: get unreasonable again then Andrew
[5:55 PM] 공상: as u always do
[5:55 PM] 공상: and read what u want into what I say
[5:56 PM] Raccoon Friend: I think your could benefit from adding the tiniest spec of optimism into your worldview(edited)
[5:57 PM] Raccoon Friend: and not just impose your misplaced sense of nilhism and pessimism onto everyone like it's some zero sum game(edited)
[5:57 PM] 공상: I think you should chill
[5:57 PM] 공상: that is all I will say
[5:57 PM] Raccoon Friend: You depress me sometimes man(edited)
[5:58 PM] 공상: You do it to yourself
[5:58 PM] 공상: you assume what you want from what I write
[5:59 PM] 공상: and you don't accept when I correct you
[5:59 PM] 공상: There is nothing more I can do
[5:59 PM] Raccoon Friend: If that's true then it's pretty crazy how you're the only person it happens with
[5:59 PM] 공상: Can't argue facts
[6:00 PM] 공상: I believe at every point I've said that we should encourage children
[6:00 PM] 공상: yet you came out with "you're so depressing and pessimistic"
[6:00 PM] 공상: so you tell me what's happening here.
[6:00 PM] 공상: I've just stressed that we be more realistic with our encouragement
[6:01 PM] 공상: and teach them to value hard work and etc rather than results
[6:01 PM] 공상: But you decided for yourself that I'm being nihilistic and pessmistic
[6:01 PM] 공상: What I have said doesn't line up with those ideals at all
[6:02 PM] 공상: I have not said to teach kids that life is pointless
[6:02 PM] 공상: and you shouldn't even try
[6:05 PM] Raccoon Friend: I was taught the exact things you're saying and it did not work on me at all, it only made me feel I couldnt do anything and no matter how hard I worked it wouldnt be enough. I choose to believe what I do because it makes sense to me. I know the same thing won't work for everyone, so I dont think you can reasonable say my points are wrong or less viable than your own.
[6:06 PM] 공상: That doesn't sound like you were taught to value hard work and to recognize your talents and abilities, that sounds like you were taught it was pointless
[6:07 PM] 공상: Which is not what I'm advocating
[6:07 PM] 공상: you haven't explained at all why inflating kids expectations is a good thing
[6:07 PM] Raccoon Friend: Although you're standing by your way in an argument Im not sure that outlook is making you as happy as you could be so Im just trying to give something else that might help
[6:09 PM] 공상: I don't see how my opinion of what we teach kids affects my happiness at all
[6:09 PM] 공상: I'm reasonably happy anyway lol
[6:09 PM] Raccoon Friend: Even if you overinflate a kid's expectations on what they are capable of (at the time and later in life) It's much easier and mentally more healthy to teach them to temper their expectations later when they're older and realize not everything is possible.
[6:10 PM] Raccoon Friend: Since when?
[6:10 PM] Raccoon Friend: I thought we were all miserable here
[6:10 PM] 공상: or it can make them crash and burn
[6:10 PM] 공상: encourage them but be reasonable
[6:10 PM] 공상: that's my whole theme
[6:10 PM] 공상: and idk people change
[6:11 PM] Raccoon Friend: Encourage them that if they do their best they will have a good chance of succeeding
[6:11 PM] 공상: iduno when exactly it happened
[6:11 PM] 공상: that's more reasonable yes(edited)
[6:11 PM] Raccoon Friend: and idk people change I vaguely recall you arguing against this before
[6:11 PM] Raccoon Friend: @pizza
[6:12 PM] Raccoon Friend: either way im glad
[6:12 PM] 공상: and yes
[6:12 PM] 공상: I was wrong

[6:12 PM] Raccoon Friend: maybe you and subhanshu did(edited)
[6:12 PM] Raccoon Friend: i dont remember

[6:13 PM] Raccoon Friend: that are lost and internet archaeologists will find 10,000 years from now
[6:13 PM] 공상: well be on Mars by then
[6:14 PM] 공상: but yeah that's all I can say about the arguments
[6:14 PM] Raccoon Friend: I hope Mars kicks us out
6:15 PM] 공상: I didn't say anything particularly sad or depressing
[6:15 PM] 공상: lol
[6:15 PM] 공상: I don't think I have for a while

[6:16 PM] Raccoon Friend: j;bfsd
[6:16 PM] pizza: It makes you think that mike can win the scare games
[6:16 PM] pizza: Hold on actually gimme 10 minutes I'll type this out on pc in a bit
[6:17 PM] Raccoon Friend: I never saw it so I can't start an argument here :ohShit:
[6:17 PM] pizza: Don't have to. Just gimme a bit
[6:17 PM] pizza: I'll be back soon
[6:17 PM] 공상: uh

[6:17 PM] Raccoon Friend: nuclear sirens
[6:18 PM] 공상: I should rename this to Train Safe Space
[6:18 PM] 공상: but I like alphabet soup a lot
[6:18 PM] 공상: lol
[6:19 PM] Raccoon Friend: I wish some of you would see IT so we can talk about it
[6:19 PM] 공상: No.
[6:20 PM] Raccoon Friend: I used to be a huge horror movie wuss too is ok
[6:20 PM] Raccoon Friend: if I can do it you can
[6:20 PM] 공상: I enjoy sleeping
[6:20 PM] 공상: I don't care if I can
[6:20 PM] 공상: I emphatically do not want
[6:20 PM] 공상: more importantly
[6:20 PM] Raccoon Friend: You know what's worse than seeing a horror movie?
[6:20 PM] 공상: I very much so want to not(edited)
[6:21 PM] Raccoon Friend: what does that even mean
[6:22 PM] 공상: I want to not watch a movie?
[6:22 PM] Raccoon Friend: what's worse is seeing a horror movie with Michaela
[6:22 PM] Raccoon Friend: or any movie
[6:22 PM] Raccoon Friend: Don't get me wrong I'm crazy about that girl
[6:22 PM] Raccoon Friend: but
[6:23 PM] Raccoon Friend: she is the worst movie theatre company ever
[6:23 PM] 공상: lol
[6:23 PM] Raccoon Friend: "Is she gonna die?"
[6:24 PM] Raccoon Friend: "is something bad about to happen?"
[6:24 PM] Raccoon Friend: "didn't we see that knife earlier?"
[6:24 PM] Raccoon Friend: "I hate her!"
[6:24 PM] Raccoon Friend: "Why are they splitting up?"
6:24 PM] Raccoon Friend: "Wait what happened?"
[6:24 PM] Raccoon Friend: "who's that?!?!"
[6:25 PM] Raccoon Friend: "Good for him!"
[6:25 PM] Raccoon Friend: "Why is she running?"
[6:26 PM] Raccoon Friend: "They did the same thing in the beginning!"
[6:26 PM] 공상: You know
[6:26 PM] Raccoon Friend: All at full speaking volume btw
[6:27 PM] Raccoon Friend: she doesn't even whisper it
[6:27 PM] 공상: You could pull a Subhanshu
[6:27 PM] 공상: Just look at her and say
[6:28 PM] 공상: "... Shut."(edited)
[6:28 PM] Raccoon Friend: I shushed her like a toddler at least 26 times last night
[6:29 PM] Raccoon Friend: at some points I was more afraid of the other audience members yelling at us than the fucking homocidial monsterclown on the screen
[6:36 PM] 공상: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V5FYDPW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_.qWUzbTHN1AMZ(edited)
[6:36 PM] 공상: I proffer
[6:36 PM] 공상: I foresee nothing that could go wrong
[6:40 PM] pizza: k i'm back
[6:40 PM] pizza: okay so Monster's University
[6:40 PM] pizza: here's what I was gonna say @Raccoon Friend @공상
[6:40 PM] pizza: The first like 75% of that movie is super by-the-numbers
[6:40 PM] pizza: mike's a small monster who wants to become a scarer but he's constantly told that he can't be one
[6:41 PM] pizza: so he studies and works hard and doesn't give up
[6:41 PM] pizza: and the turning point of the movie revolves aroudn this competition on campus called the scare games
[6:41 PM] pizza: and mike is up for his team for the final event
[6:41 PM] pizza: which is to scare this bot meant to simulate a kid or something, the more you scare it the more points you get
[6:42 PM] pizza: and after all this studying and practice and dedication, he goes into the room and scares the monster and gets the highest score and wins for his team
[6:42 PM] pizza: and it's such a basic, feelsgoodman ending
[6:42 PM] pizza: just a whole "don't listen to others and just believe in yourself and you can do it"
[6:42 PM] pizza: UNTIL the last like 30 minutes
[6:43 PM] pizza: where sully reveals to him that before mike went into the room to do his scare for the competition, he rigged the machine to have like 0 sensitivity, so that any scare would register as a topscore
[6:43 PM] pizza: mike doesn't believe him and goes through a door into the human world and tries to scare a whole bunch of kids and doesn't scare any of them
[6:43 PM] pizza: and he realizes that he can't scare because he simply can't. he wasn't born for it. He's too small and non-intimidating. It's a slap in the face where he realizes that his dream of being a scarer and scaring kids can't pan out anymore
[6:44 PM] pizza: somethign happens in the human world and sully and mike are trapped in some shed and some adult humans are gonna raid it
[6:44 PM] pizza: and mike thinks on his feet and sets traps and sets up the atmosphere of the place in like 30 seconds for the adults to be scared by sully
[6:44 PM] pizza: and through his planning and quick wits, they're both able to scare the shti out of the adults and make it out alive
[6:45 PM] pizza: and so like, the moral of the story was to find what you're good at and excel in that
[6:45 PM] pizza: they could have just ended the movie with mike winning the competition and that was that
[6:45 PM] pizza: THAT's what kung fu panda's ending is
[6:45 PM] pizza: fat panda just becomes dragon warrior bc the 'spark was in him the whole time and he could do it and there's no special ingredient'
[6:45 PM] pizza: and like, it's an entertaining movie
[6:45 PM] pizza: with amazing animation, great acting, and a fun premise
[6:46 PM] pizza: but I think that's what fancy and I mean with it being shallow
[6:46 PM] pizza: like the MU moral has like, deeper truth
[6:46 PM] pizza: does that kinda sum up what you were thinking @공상
[6:47 PM] 공상: basically
[6:47 PM] 공상: I vaguely remember that movie
[6:47 PM] 공상: but it's tainted by
[6:47 PM] 공상: the realization that I was on a date
[6:47 PM] 공상: except I didn't know it
[6:47 PM] 공상: rofl
[6:48 PM] 공상: rip
[6:49 PM] pizza: like it's not a great movie, but that message is something deeper than normal
[6:49 PM] pizza: because as I said, most of the movie is super conventional and noninteresting
[6:49 PM] pizza: but that message is deeper than the kung fu panda main message, which is you can do anything if you believe in yourself
[6:51 PM] 공상: yeah
[6:51 PM] 공상: there's more to the message
[6:51 PM] 공상: its more complicated than just pick something and win
[6:51 PM] pizza: like i give MU a lot of respect for being like "No, this thing you believe isn't true. You CAN'T just do anything if you try your hardest. Some things arne't meant to be. Doesn't mean you still can't succeed elsewhere and be happy"
[6:54 PM] 공상: yeah
[6:54 PM] 공상: have you seen inside out
[6:54 PM] 공상: I was forced to cus it plays in one of my stores
[6:54 PM] 공상: correction
[6:55 PM] 공상: I was forced to see it 4 times in a row
[6:56 PM] 공상: it's the same kind of happy ending but without making it just blatantly unrealistic
[6:57 PM] pizza: @Raccoon Friend comparing Kung Fu Panda to any of the Toy Story movies is like comparing, like, Doctor Strange to The Dark Knight
[6:57 PM] pizza: Both are good movies, but one completely transcends the genre that it's based in and becomes a deeper tale
[6:58 PM] pizza: @공상 I know you don't cry at shit in movies and stuff but this shit makes me tear up every time
[6:58 PM] pizza: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElhbTsKsros

[6:58 PM] pizza: @Coeurdleon you should weigh in on all this lol
[6:59 PM] 공상: he's probably just getting home
[6:59 PM] 공상: or something
[6:59 PM] Coeurdleon: ye one sec im reading it all
[7:00 PM] 공상: tldr baby hera is adorable af and we should all get her
[7:01 PM] Raccoon Friend: yeah
[7:02 PM] 공상: I want a baby hera plush tbh
[7:03 PM] Coeurdleon: ok, hold the fucking phone
[7:03 PM] Coeurdleon: animation
[7:03 PM] Coeurdleon: is
[7:03 PM] Coeurdleon: not
[7:03 PM] Coeurdleon: a genre
[7:03 PM] pizza: like
[7:03 PM] Coeurdleon: no
[7:03 PM] Coeurdleon: its a medium
[7:03 PM] pizza: the genre i refer to is kid's movies
[7:03 PM] pizza: yes
[7:03 PM] pizza: that's what i was trying to say earlier
[7:03 PM] Coeurdleon: thats like saying books or movies are genres
[7:03 PM] pizza: animation movies aren't required to be comedic
[7:03 PM] pizza: or "for kids"
[7:03 PM] pizza: the genre i refer to
[7:03 PM] pizza: that toy story transcends
[7:03 PM] pizza: is children movies
[7:03 PM] Coeurdleon: kids movies also dont have to be animated
[7:03 PM] pizza: yes
[7:04 PM] Coeurdleon: its just easy to make cute mascot characters when you animate thinfs
[7:04 PM] pizza: toy story transcends the kids genre of movies
[7:04 PM] 공상: it's a bad name for the genre tbh
[7:04 PM] 공상: but it's the name most people use
[7:04 PM] 공상: like if you go to rotten tomatoes the genre is animated
[7:05 PM] 공상: just like dota is a moba
[7:05 PM] 공상: also a bad name for a genre
[7:05 PM] 공상: cus it literally means any game that has multiple players that battle
[7:05 PM] 공상: fifa online is a fucking moba
[7:06 PM] 공상: but I digress
[7:17 PM] Coeurdleon: they call it a genre because the scope of animation is really limited in the west
[7:19 PM] Coeurdleon: because animation and kids movies go in hand more often than not
[7:19 PM] Coeurdleon: the other reason is because it makes it easier to sort animatd things as a genre in terms of ui
[7:20 PM] 공상: yes
[7:20 PM] 공상: same for moba
[7:20 PM] 공상: still bad
[7:20 PM] Coeurdleon: genres are defined by similarites in form style or subject matter
[7:20 PM] 공상: yes bad name is bad we agree
[7:21 PM] 공상: now help me find
[7:21 PM] 공상: baby hera plish
[7:21 PM] 공상: plush
[7:23 PM] Coeurdleon: i also agree with the principle that, while its a good movie and a fun watch, KFP is a shallow, token movie and that the "you can do anything if you try" mentality is a waste of time
[7:23 PM] Coeurdleon: MU has a much better moral
[7:23 PM] Coeurdleon: it says that you might not be able to do what you want to do regardless of how you try but that doesnt change that you have strengths of your own
[7:24 PM] Coeurdleon: and that your strengths make you able to do things other people cant
[7:24 PM] Coeurdleon: sully can scare people
[7:24 PM] Coeurdleon: but he cant set up a haunted cabin atmosphere
[7:24 PM] Coeurdleon: only mike could do that
[7:29 PM] Coeurdleon: the iron giant is a fantastic movie with a similar "you are who you choose to be" premise
[7:29 PM] Coeurdleon: but the way it plays out is that its about accepting who you are in the face of others
[7:30 PM] pizza: did oyu know that iron giant had a 70 mil budget but only grossed 19 mil
[7:30 PM] Coeurdleon: thats honestly a tragedy
[7:30 PM] pizza: yep lol meanwhile minions had 70 mil budget and grossed 1.2 bill
[7:30 PM] Coeurdleon: its a msterpiece and i watched it probably over a hundred times
[7:30 PM] pizza: it's so fucking good
[7:31 PM] Coeurdleon: just reading a synopsis almost made me tear up a bit
7:31 PM] pizza: You stay. I go.
[7:31 PM] pizza: fucking Superman
[7:34 PM] pizza: I have also not seen the kung fu panda sequels and don't know if those are any deeper
[7:37 PM] 공상: im
[7:37 PM] 공상: so
[7:37 PM] 공상: hypedddddd
[7:37 PM] 공상: to play dotaaaaaaaaa
[7:37 PM] 공상: DOOOOOTTTTAAAAAAA
[7:38 PM] pizza: pulls out the elephant tranquilizer
[7:39 PM] 공상: ;~;
[7:39 PM] Coeurdleon: Alright. Ill be here for dota but i might be like 5-10 minutes late
[7:39 PM] Coeurdleon: If you can tell the "officers" that that would be awesome
[7:39 PM] 공상: I am officer
[7:39 PM] pizza: i am officer too
[7:39 PM] 공상: that means I get privileges
[7:39 PM] pizza: god
[7:39 PM] pizza: someone scrub my tongue
[7:39 PM] 공상: like going to sad meeting
[7:39 PM] Coeurdleon: Cuz im going bowling down the street at 8 for like an hour
[7:39 PM] pizza: ah nice
[7:39 PM] pizza: i got three exams tomorrow
[7:39 PM] 공상: win for me
[7:40 PM] Coeurdleon: And ill be done by 9 but i have to walk back
[7:40 PM] pizza: but i go to practice to preserve fancy's dream
[7:40 PM] 공상: <3
[7:41 PM] pizza: With great power comes great responsibility.
[7:42 PM] Coeurdleon: Thats basically the moral of iron giant
[7:42 PM] Coeurdleon: Or one of them
[7:48 PM] pizza: @Raccoon Friend did you read all that stuffs
[7:59 PM] Raccoon Friend: YALL DONT APPRECIATE FEELGOOD ART AND YALL ARE SAD
[8:00 PM] Raccoon Friend: ITS FUNNY AND EDUCATIONAL AND IS POSITIVE
[8:00 PM] Raccoon Friend: KILL ME
[8:02 PM] pizza: I accept your surrender
[8:03 PM] Raccoon Friend: you may think it's shallow but it's still good and worth watching and took a lot of hard work and creativity and passion
[8:03 PM] pizza: And we acknowledged all of those things
[8:03 PM] pizza: I love that movie, we all think it's great
[8:03 PM] pizza: and super fun to watch
[8:03 PM] pizza: I've seen it at least like 6 times
[8:04 PM] pizza: I love the setting of the movie, I love the voice acting, I love the animation quality and style
[8:04 PM] pizza: I really like the story too, it's simple and enjoyable
[8:04 PM] pizza: and the movie's funny in some spots
[8:04 PM] pizza: but this conversation started because you nominated it as the best animated movie ever
[8:04 PM] pizza: And so I contested that
[8:10 PM] 공상: yeah wtf
[8:10 PM] 공상: stop making wild accusations
[8:10 PM] 공상: ur like a teenaged girl
[8:11 PM] 공상: OMG BRIAN DIDNT LIKE MY NEW BRACELET MY LIFE IS OVER HE HATES MEEEEEE
[8:11 PM] 공상: we said like 5 times it's a good movie
[8:12 PM] 공상: pizza said it was underrated
[8:12 PM] 공상: it's very funny and enjoyable to watch
[8:12 PM] 공상: the only thing we contested was that it was the goat
[8:12 PM] 공상: cus it's not lol
[8:12 PM] 공상: but that's okay
[8:13 PM] Raccoon Friend: ok fuck you guys why do you have to step on me every time I try to say anything
[8:13 PM] 공상: what
[8:13 PM] pizza: WHAT YOU ASKED US TO CHALLENGE IT
[8:13 PM] 공상: you asked

[8:23 PM] Raccoon Friend: take me off the pinned list I dont want that
[8:23 PM] pizza: if we always agreed, then we're actually just validating each other and not learning anything
[8:23 PM] 공상: no Andrew you must face reality lol
[8:23 PM] pizza: you asked for a debate but then get mad because all three of us disagreed?
[8:23 PM] 공상: and Andrew we see the world in very different ways
[8:24 PM] pizza: and frankly that's fine
[8:24 PM] 공상: of course we don't see things the same way
[8:24 PM] pizza: i see it differently than josh does
[8:24 PM] 공상: that doesn't make either of us right or wrong
[8:24 PM] 공상: I don't argue to win
[8:24 PM] 공상: the point isn't to win
8:24 PM] Raccoon Friend: lol right
[8:24 PM] 공상: but like I've said before, and pizza said now, you often have the habit of not actually addressing the arguments
[8:25 PM] 공상: at no point did I tell you you shouldn't love kfp
[8:25 PM] 공상: or think it's the best ever
[8:25 PM] pizza: at no point did we call you a simpleton for being enamored with a children's movie with a shallow (in our mind) message
[8:25 PM] Raccoon Friend: I dont have time for this anymore
[8:25 PM] pizza: like you just call fancy a nihilist bc he disagrees instead of hearing out what he has to say
[8:25 PM] 공상: because we dont think that
[8:25 PM] Raccoon Friend: I wasted all of today with this
[8:26 PM] pizza: Andrew, what did you want us to do when you asked us to debate whether KFP was the best animated movie of all time?
[8:26 PM] pizza: Was it lie about what we thought?
[8:26 PM] pizza: Explain what you think we did wrong
[8:26 PM] pizza: Bc i'm still not sure what the issue is here
[8:27 PM] Raccoon Friend: I wrote that after finishing watching it again and was really excited at the time, and while I did want to discuss it it quickly turned to hostility and now we're in this place where I no longer want to care about what either of you have to say about it
[8:27 PM] pizza: hostility?
[8:27 PM] pizza: explain
[8:27 PM] 공상: who was hostile
[8:27 PM] pizza: were we hostile towards you?
[8:28 PM] pizza: I think you confuse disagreement with conflict
[8:29 PM] Raccoon Friend: what always happens, we start dicussing something, and as a part of a point we tangent off into some sociocultural issue that has no real answer and we bark at each other until I can't take it anymore
[8:29 PM] pizza: I don't like pineapple on pizza, if you guys were like "no actually i really like it i like the combination and find it really tasty"
[8:29 PM] pizza: i wouldn't be like "fuck you guys you're just saying that bc i don't like it
[8:29 PM] pizza: okay but show me how that happened here
[8:29 PM] Raccoon Friend: I dont have enough finger muscles to scroll that far
[8:29 PM] 공상: also when that happens you aren't free of blame
[8:29 PM] 공상: it takes two to have a discussion
[8:30 PM] Raccoon Friend: At this point I dont even care anymore
[8:30 PM] Raccoon Friend: Just leave me alone
[8:30 PM] Raccoon Friend: It was dumb to claim it was the GOAT and you guys are teasing me about it
[8:30 PM] Raccoon Friend: fuck off
[8:30 PM] 공상: no one is teasing you
[8:32 PM] Raccoon Friend: I just want to playt csgo at night when I can I dont want this
[8:32 PM] Raccoon Friend: but instead this is a thing
[8:33 PM] Raccoon Friend: so;daifg hdsilugja hbndflkijghbaq';[osrfduj
[8:33 PM] 공상: ?
[8:34 PM] 공상: use your words
[8:34 PM] Raccoon Friend: Dont talk to me like that
[8:34 PM] 공상: and talk about what you want to say lol
[8:34 PM] pizza: Sorry you don't want our opinions and wanna have conversations. I'm sorry that I don't enjoy csgo right now and that I'm going through a phase of enjoying tf2. I'm sorry that I have to go to bed at midnight because otherwise i sleep through class. I'm sorry that I have 8am classes. I'm sorry that I mistook your invite to debate as an actual invitation to voice my opinion and how I felt about something I passionately enjoy.
[8:34 PM] 공상: Andrew if you act like that I'm going to say that
[8:34 PM] 공상: lol
[8:35 PM] 공상: this is hope part two bless up
[8:35 PM] Raccoon Friend: Then you're just an asshole @공상
[8:35 PM] 공상: you're spamming the keyboard
[8:35 PM] 공상: instead of presenting the problem
8:35 PM] Raccoon Friend: I guess we just can't hangout then @pizza
[8:36 PM] Raccoon Friend: Who's gonna stop me?
[8:36 PM] Raccoon Friend: you?
[8:36 PM] Raccoon Friend: ban me
[8:36 PM] Raccoon Friend: watch what happens
[8:36 PM] pizza: If what you need in a friend that you interact with frequently is someone who's perfectly aligned with you and your opinions and won't dispute you when we disagree, then I can't do that for you.
[8:36 PM] 공상: what
[8:36 PM] Raccoon Friend: hint: I'll be banned
[8:36 PM] 공상: Andrew you're making less sense
[8:36 PM] pizza: Like, if the requirement for us to talk is that we agree about everything, then that's honestly more shallow than anything.
[8:36 PM] Raccoon Friend: Who said I had to
[8:36 PM] Raccoon Friend: You're taking it to the extreme
[8:36 PM] 공상: people who have real relationships with communication
[8:36 PM] Raccoon Friend: @pizza
[8:37 PM] 공상: uh
[8:37 PM] 공상: he's not
[8:37 PM] pizza: you just said you don't care about what we have to say
[8:37 PM] pizza: you just said that this happens 'every time'
[8:37 PM] pizza: and that we 'bully you'
[8:37 PM] 공상: yes
[8:37 PM] pizza: bullying and making fun and teasing are pretty serious accusations in a friendship lol
[8:38 PM] 공상: pizza memes that I'm cute
[8:38 PM] 공상: but that's not bullying
[8:40 PM] Raccoon Friend: To be honest it feels like none of us are really friends during the year. Only for a couple weeks each summer
[8:40 PM] Raccoon Friend: which is dumb
[8:40 PM] Raccoon Friend: Not to mention you 3 are the only ones here I really know
[8:41 PM] 공상: isn't that just a product of life being busy
[8:41 PM] Raccoon Friend: bunch of strangers. Had 2 good times with Badger but we dont share any interests
[8:41 PM] 공상: We're friends still
[8:41 PM] 공상: but this is how life goes
[8:41 PM] 공상: people get busy
[8:42 PM] 공상: my dad has friends he's sees twice a year
[8:42 PM] Raccoon Friend: Just feels shitty
