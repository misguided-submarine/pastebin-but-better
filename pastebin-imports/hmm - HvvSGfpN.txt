9:37 AM] fancy: do you remember when I said that I'm a bad person to date
[9:37 AM] fancy: part of that has to do with how
[9:38 AM] fancy: I more or less refuse to do things if I don't want to do them
[9:38 AM] fancy: I've never really been big on the whole "I will do ur shit with u if u do my shit with me" thing
[9:38 AM] fancy: this is part of why I was so aggressive about Jeff to Bani
[9:39 AM] fancy: because he had that same attitude, where he doesn't really care necessarily if they did any specific things together
[9:39 AM] fancy: he didn't expect her to do things he liked if she didn't
[9:39 AM] fancy: and he didn't feel he should be expected to do things she liked that he didn't
[9:39 AM] fancy: I'm the same way
[9:40 AM] fancy: I don't expect you to ever do stuff with me just as an excuse to do stuff with me
[9:40 AM] fancy: I don't expect it, and I don't even think it's like... that admirable in general, I guess?
[9:40 AM] fancy: to me, it just seems insane
[9:41 AM] fancy: maybe some people can look past the fakeness of pretending to enjoy something for the sake of someone else
[9:41 AM] fancy: but I can't
[9:42 AM] fancy: I don't want to do things with people that aren't enjoying the activity
[9:42 AM] fancy: it just makes things awkward and less fun
[9:43 AM] fancy: you ask sometimes if I want to play something
[9:43 AM] fancy: but it's rarely ever something specific
[9:43 AM] fancy: and it very much comes off of
[9:43 AM] fancy: "I'm not really interested in playing whatever game you're going to suggest but i feel obligated to ask for your sake so here I am"
[9:43 AM] fancy: and that just doesn't interest me
[9:44 AM] fancy: to use dota as an example
[9:45 AM] fancy: there's such an overwhelming pile on the side of you just bitching about the game, or saying it's bad or not fun, or loading in and being like, "I don't want to play any of these heroes", or any other number of negative things
[9:45 AM] fancy: that it's like
[9:45 AM] fancy: from my perspective
[9:46 AM] fancy: it would be insane to keep inviting you or accepting the offers/requests you (seemingly) make out of sense of obligation
[9:46 AM] fancy: and maybe you actually do want to play recently, idk
[9:47 AM] fancy: but like I had to try (and fail) to explain to tyler the other day, the world doesn't exist in a vacuum that resets every day
[9:47 AM] fancy: context exists
[9:49 AM] fancy: do I wish you enjoyed more of the things I did
[9:49 AM] fancy: like actively enjoyed?
[9:49 AM] fancy: of course
[9:49 AM] fancy: I like playing things with you
[9:49 AM] fancy: when you guys aren't just being mean to me, that is
[9:49 AM] fancy: but like
[9:49 AM] fancy: if you don't
[9:50 AM] fancy: I'm not gonna sit around all melancholy and complain
[9:50 AM] fancy: and keep bringing it up
[9:50 AM] fancy: I used to do that
[9:50 AM] fancy: it didn't help anything
[9:50 AM] fancy: lol
[9:51 AM] fancy: your thing about how I used to talk about how everyone is going to move on
[9:51 AM] fancy: trying to avoid that is like trying to avoid death
[9:51 AM] fancy: stop worrying about it
[9:51 AM] fancy: yeah, wanna be sad about it when you reflect on that fact sometime? sure
[9:51 AM] fancy: I am
[9:51 AM] fancy: but like
[9:52 AM] fancy: you aren't going to be able tos top it
[9:52 AM] fancy: and if you try to force it
[9:52 AM] fancy: you're just gonna stress yourself out
[9:53 AM] fancy: maybe I gave the wrong impression
[9:53 AM] fancy: but like
[9:53 AM] fancy: do I wish life didn't work that way?
[9:53 AM] fancy: maybe a little bit-but I probably wish that less than I did 2 years ago
[9:54 AM] fancy: because I have more perspective now and maybe there's something to things having finite windows
[9:54 AM] fancy: I don't know
[9:54 AM] fancy: but like
[9:54 AM] fancy: I don't want anything artificial
[9:54 AM] fancy: I've always hated artificiality and facade
[9:54 AM] fancy: it's both boring and unfulfilling to interact with
[9:55 AM] fancy: --
[9:55 AM] fancy: the dota thing isn't personal
[9:55 AM] fancy: I think I've said before
[9:56 AM] fancy: my dota experience these days
[9:56 AM] fancy: is playing with nikki
[9:56 AM] fancy: and putting up with whoever she chooses to invite
[9:57 AM] fancy: I have a really hard time enjoying dota
[9:57 AM] fancy: when I party with people
[9:57 AM] fancy: I think I said this about csgo too
[9:57 AM] fancy: that I get less frustrated when I soloq
[9:58 AM] fancy: but at least I feel like I can talk about dota with nikki in a reasonable way
[9:59 AM] fancy: because she doesn't complain bitterly about how the game is balanced
[9:59 AM] fancy: every other sentence
[9:59 AM] fancy: because it feels like she is as invested in the game as I am
[10:00 AM] fancy: I think you overvalue how much I compliment people and I think you discount how delicate everyone is
[10:01 AM] fancy: I praise jules when he does good because I don't want him to just tilt out and get sullen for the 600th time
[10:01 AM] fancy: I praise yoshi when he does good because I expect little and because he was part of the group that would get really upset when I get annoyed
[10:01 AM] fancy: is it a means to an end?
[10:01 AM] fancy: yeah
[10:01 AM] fancy: it is
[10:01 AM] fancy: but yoshi I don't think gives a fuck about me as a person so I don't really care
[10:02 AM] fancy: and with julian I just want to survive the game without everyone being in a bad mood
[10:03 AM] fancy: I have to be careful praising people like you because of how you act
[10:03 AM] fancy: you say you don't do this
[10:03 AM] fancy: but like
[10:03 AM] fancy: it's very hard for me to tell
[10:03 AM] fancy: if the whole
[10:03 AM] fancy: "justifying a bad play cus it worked" thing
[10:03 AM] fancy: is a meme
[10:03 AM] fancy: or not
[10:03 AM] fancy: because you say you don't actually think that way
[10:03 AM] fancy: and yet
[10:03 AM] fancy: that's not really what I've seen
[10:03 AM] fancy: that's the impression I have at least
