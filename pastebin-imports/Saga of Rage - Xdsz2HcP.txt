[12:51 PM] fancy: do you get salty when you die in RuneScape
[12:53 PM] Suck it, Moto!: yes but not as much
[12:54 PM] Suck it, Moto!: depends.
[12:54 PM] fancy: hmmm
[12:54 PM] fancy: why are you so adverse to "losing"
[12:54 PM] fancy: and why do you play games where you don't enjoy the act of playing the game
[12:54 PM] fancy: ?
[12:55 PM] Suck it, Moto!: if I die to a boss or a monster or some NPC, it's usually because I just wasnt paying attention, in which case im not too salty. Some bosses are super hard and I cant beat them.
[12:55 PM] Suck it, Moto!: If I get player killed, i get salty
[12:55 PM] Suck it, Moto!: HOWEVER
[12:55 PM] Suck it, Moto!: the only time that  happens is when Im in the wilderness doing some else ( i never pk mostly because internet and frames)
[12:56 PM] Suck it, Moto!: So, theoretically if you never go in the wilderness you can never get pk'd
[12:56 PM] Suck it, Moto!: So Im in control of how mmuch I risk and when I decide to risk it
[12:57 PM] Suck it, Moto!: So when I die I dont feel as bad
[12:57 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I enjoy the act of playing runescape
[12:57 PM] fancy: hmm
[12:57 PM] fancy: I see
[12:58 PM] fancy: That's odd
[12:59 PM] fancy: why is it so much worse to get player killed
[1:01 PM] fancy: How is it any different from dying to a difficult boss
[1:02 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Because the other person beats you. There's pretty much a well documented menthod to every boss/monster in runescape. But player killing is more meta and more dynamic. Plus if they kill you they get your items/money
[1:02 PM] fancy: So why don't you just beat them?
[1:02 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I dont have the skills
[1:02 PM] fancy: So why not get them
[1:03 PM] fancy: Why would you choose to get upset that someone is better yet not try to also get better
[1:03 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Because buy n large that aspect of the game is pretty avoidable
[1:03 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Im more interesting in my PvM goals and leveling
[1:03 PM] Suck it, Moto!: interested
[1:03 PM] fancy: Hmm
[1:03 PM] fancy: Odd
[1:04 PM] Suck it, Moto!: There are many ways to play runescape
[1:04 PM] fancy: I don't contest that
[1:04 PM] fancy: What about frisbee golf(edited)
[1:04 PM] fancy: are you upset to lose that?
[1:05 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Yes, but only if I go to a tournament where there are actual stakes
[1:05 PM] Suck it, Moto!: If it's just me and dumbasses I dont even keep score
[1:05 PM] fancy: okay. so what are the actual stakes in versus or dota or something?
[1:05 PM] fancy: why's it different
[1:06 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I guess there are no stakes, especially if I dont have any mmr to lose
[1:06 PM] Suck it, Moto!: that's a good point
[1:06 PM] fancy: even if you lose mmr, so what
[1:06 PM] fancy: people make a huge deal out of it
[1:06 PM] fancy: because they lose sight of the fact that the whole point is to help match you into a balanced game
[1:07 PM] fancy: if I suddenly dropped 3k MMR for whatever reason but I still played against the same skill of player, what really changed(edited)
[1:07 PM] fancy: ya know
[1:07 PM] Suck it, Moto!: People want to fufill their ideas of how good they are, so if they lose a game for "preventable reasons" they'll feel their mmr is no longer accurate and thus a mistake that needs correcting
[1:07 PM] fancy: that's more of an aside
[1:07 PM] Suck it, Moto!: MMR has value only because we give it valie
[1:07 PM] Suck it, Moto!: value
[1:07 PM] fancy: well yeah, you can always get better
[1:07 PM] fancy: but that doesn't have to do with the mmr
[1:08 PM] fancy: I still get upset even tho there's no visible MMR in unranked
[1:08 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Yeah Idk then
[1:08 PM] fancy: because in my opinion, I could win every game I played if I did it well enough
[1:08 PM] fancy: but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy the game even if I lose
[1:08 PM] fancy: sometimes you lose, and that's the only way you learn something really
[1:09 PM] fancy: I dont learn much from aggressively trying to carry Redman in dota and sometimes succeeding and sometimes failing
[1:11 PM] fancy: I'll remember my hole in one car forever tho
[1:11 PM] fancy: or my 14k damage tank
[1:11 PM] fancy: idr if we won those maps even
[1:11 PM] Suck it, Moto!: yeah that's often how I remember disc golf
[1:12 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I may not remember the score but if there was a great single shot I did or witnessed i'll remember it forever
[1:12 PM] fancy: ye exactly
[1:12 PM] Suck it, Moto!: All i know is my team hasnt won the past 3 games or whatever since we started again
[1:12 PM] fancy: we play for the moments of Trevor saying "it's the infected vs the suspected"
[1:13 PM] fancy: and etc
[1:13 PM] fancy: and the cars
[1:13 PM] fancy: and etc
[1:18 PM] fancy: the only thing I care about is my performance
[1:18 PM] fancy: it's why I'm like actually super willing to do 1v4
[1:18 PM] fancy: even if I'll probably get smashed
[1:18 PM] fancy: because that's how much I want to test myself
[1:19 PM] fancy: same thing for 2v4
[1:19 PM] fancy: I enjoy 2v4 not bevause I think it's easier but because it's a greater test of skills
[1:21 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Having teams of uneven amounts of people is weird because the bots are relatively inconsistent and are really good at some things, and terrible at other things
[1:21 PM] Suck it, Moto!: like the bots can clear and shoot way better than me or trevor or gabe
[1:21 PM] Suck it, Moto!: but they are dogshit as infected (most of the time)
[1:22 PM] fancy: they can be good survivors
[1:22 PM] fancy: and they can also be complete shit
[1:22 PM] fancy: and ignore people getting downed because they can't prioritize or think on the fly
[1:23 PM] fancy: they don't pre aim corners or common spots
[1:23 PM] fancy: and sometimes they can pull off insane infected plays
[1:23 PM] fancy: because they don't hesitate or get lucky on timing
[1:25 PM] fancy: basically they are incapable of being proactive
[1:26 PM] fancy: but even then I'd still be willing to 2v4 without bots at all
[1:27 PM] Suck it, Moto!: that would be interesting
[1:27 PM] fancy: only works on some maps I think
[1:28 PM] fancy: because 2 infected is not a lot
[3:18 PM] Suck it, Moto!: @fancy  Also I should note. When I mentioned how game salt stems from real attitude issues, you said that' no reason to not work on it. I very much do work on it. My aggregate life salt levels are at an all time low. I used to be an angry child. Now I'm a less angry man-child!
[3:19 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Unfortunately game salt hasnt been fully cured
[3:21 PM] fancy: Yeah, I didn't mean to say you've made no progress
[3:21 PM] fancy: But that this conversation still had merit
[3:21 PM] fancy: Also isn't man child a step below child
steammocking1
[3:22 PM] fancy: But yeah, keeping things in perspective is good, which is why I was trying to find something else you do where you also lose but don't care about it
