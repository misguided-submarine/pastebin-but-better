Flirting for Morons
There’s a fundamental misunderstanding within the community at large I’d like to correct.

[5:41 PM] MATH: read it
[5:41 PM] MATH: it was
[5:41 PM] MATH: good
[6:05 PM] LETTUCE: i watched zyoris full hours long
[6:05 PM] LETTUCE: response to sexual assault accuastion
[6:06 PM] LETTUCE: sigh
[6:06 PM] MATH: hanh
[6:06 PM] LETTUCE: kyles blog post is because of
[6:06 PM] LETTUCE: all of esports girls coming out
[6:06 PM] MATH: yeah ik
[6:06 PM] LETTUCE: what is even the correct response
[6:06 PM] LETTUCE: just to stay silent right
[6:07 PM] MATH: wym
[6:07 PM] LETTUCE: what do you do
[6:07 PM] LETTUCE: if u are the man
[6:07 PM] LETTUCE: accused
[6:07 PM] MATH: don't sexually assault people
[6:07 PM] MATH: seems pretty easy
[6:08 PM] LETTUCE: yea but he is already did it
[6:08 PM] MATH: yeah so
[6:08 PM] MATH: that is what u get
[6:08 PM] MATH: things have consequences
[6:08 PM] LETTUCE: yeah
[6:08 PM] LETTUCE: but he is making it worse
[6:08 PM] LETTUCE: XD
[6:08 PM] LETTUCE: with his response
[6:08 PM] MATH: I didn't even know zyori did anything
[6:09 PM] LETTUCE: its very long story very very long
[6:09 PM] LETTUCE: but it was he was in a postition of power
[6:09 PM] LETTUCE: and his intentions were good
[6:09 PM] LETTUCE: but trying to start a connection with someone who worked for him
[6:10 PM] MATH: yeah that's like
[6:10 PM] MATH: rule number 4
[6:10 PM] LETTUCE: yeah
[6:10 PM] MATH: of things u don't do
[6:10 PM] MATH: people just don't think of these things
[6:10 PM] LETTUCE: and he is trying to say hes a victim because she lied to him about being interested
[6:10 PM] MATH: people don't think of power dynamics
[6:10 PM] LETTUCE: and him saying he is a victim and blaming her
[6:10 PM] LETTUCE: is making it worse
[6:10 PM] MATH: yeah because he doesn't understand power dynamics
[6:10 PM] MATH: most people don't
[6:11 PM] LETTUCE: yea
[6:11 PM] MATH: esports people don't understand business
[6:11 PM] MATH: well most of them
[6:11 PM] MATH: because they've come into it from a very weird angle
[6:11 PM] MATH: just like esports players don't understand contracts
[6:11 PM] LETTUCE: and also business people dont understand business
[6:11 PM] MATH: this happens again and again
[6:11 PM] LETTUCE: XD
[6:11 PM] LETTUCE: people is just dumb
[6:11 PM] LETTUCE: it is like kyle say
[6:11 PM] LETTUCE: it is stupidity not malice
[6:11 PM] LETTUCE: but stupidity have consequences too
[6:11 PM] MATH: yeah but on average people who have been in business more have a better idea
[6:11 PM] LETTUCE: yea
[6:12 PM] MATH: vs all this
[6:12 PM] MATH: new stuff
[6:12 PM] LETTUCE: because there is more rules and HR
[6:12 PM] MATH: esports is so new
[6:12 PM] MATH: people don't know what they are doing
[6:12 PM] MATH: and so things like this is happen
[6:12 PM] MATH: people not realize that once u enter this world
[6:12 PM] MATH: that
[6:13 PM] MATH: you can't be a normal person anymore
[6:13 PM] MATH: and the more important u get
[6:13 PM] MATH: the less normal u can be even in off hours
[6:13 PM] MATH: that is just the way it works
[6:13 PM] MATH: it is unfortunate
[6:13 PM] MATH: because both the people who have the power
[6:13 PM] MATH: and the people who are attracted to it
[6:13 PM] MATH: don't really understand
[6:13 PM] MATH: what is going on
[6:13 PM] MATH: so then the person who is attracted to it ends up getting hurt
[6:14 PM] LETTUCE: that as yeah
[6:14 PM] LETTUCE: at is so scary
[6:14 PM] MATH: the issues is that a lot of the time, it's not so black and white as person in power is always 100% at fault
[6:14 PM] LETTUCE: ur must be so careful if ur is have influence
[6:14 PM] MATH: but u can't say this
[6:14 PM] MATH: cos then people get upset and throw the cases where it is 100% that person's fault at you
[6:15 PM] MATH: people are unable to have reasonable conversations
[6:15 PM] MATH: and people are unwilling to be educated
[6:15 PM] MATH: which is the root cause of all of it in the first place
[6:17 PM] LETTUCE: at is good thing i am a boy gamer
