[11:19 PM] A Random Badger: meanwhile im learning how to invest in stocks
[11:19 PM] A Random Badger: cause i wanna start doign that more with my robinhood app
[11:19 PM] A Random Badger: also
[11:19 PM] A Random Badger: you should get robinhood and take a free stock
[11:19 PM] fancy: what
[11:20 PM] A Random Badger: it gives me another free one too
[11:20 PM] fancy: that sounds questionable
[11:20 PM] fancy: I think I will just continue doing what I'm doing
[11:20 PM] A Random Badger: what is
[11:20 PM] A Random Badger: stock investing
[11:20 PM] A Random Badger: or the app i use
[11:20 PM] A Random Badger: / site
[11:20 PM] fancy: randomly investing in stocks lol
[11:20 PM] A Random Badger: well i wanna learn duh
[11:20 PM] A Random Badger: im not gonna do it randomly
[11:20 PM] fancy: well
[11:20 PM] fancy: investing in single stocks is
[11:20 PM] fancy: never the play
[11:20 PM] A Random Badger: but meanwhile
[11:20 PM] A Random Badger: free stocks
[11:20 PM] A Random Badger: on robinhood
[11:20 PM] A Random Badger: so
[11:21 PM] A Random Badger: xd
[11:21 PM] A Random Badger: but yea i know
[11:21 PM] A Random Badger: but seems like a financially smart thing to start learning and doing
[11:22 PM] fancy: uh
[11:22 PM] fancy: not really
[11:22 PM] fancy: because you don't ever invest in singular stocks
[11:23 PM] A Random Badger: true
[11:23 PM] A Random Badger: but i wouldnt want to randomly invest in multiple without knowing what im doing first
[11:23 PM] fancy: well
[11:23 PM] fancy: you don't invest in multiple single stocks either
[11:23 PM] A Random Badger: well you invest multiple in 1
[11:23 PM] A Random Badger: ik
[11:24 PM] A Random Badger: thats what you mean right
[11:24 PM] fancy: no
[11:24 PM] fancy: I don't ever pick stocks
[11:24 PM] fancy: I just invest in funds
[11:24 PM] fancy: mutual funds
[11:24 PM] fancy: and stock portfolios
[11:25 PM] A Random Badger: wym funds and mutual funds
[11:25 PM] fancy: mutual funds are a thing
[11:25 PM] A Random Badger: what are they and what do you mean by you invest in funds
[11:25 PM] fancy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund
[11:28 PM] A Random Badger: the whole fees part and unpredictable income sounds questionable to me tho
[11:28 PM] A Random Badger: or is it not that bad
[11:29 PM] fancy: well
[11:29 PM] fancy: it's not really
[11:29 PM] fancy: because you're not investing to make a profit in a short term
[11:29 PM] fancy: basically you want to invest in the economy as a whole
[11:29 PM] A Random Badger: yea
[11:29 PM] A Random Badger: i understand that
[11:29 PM] fancy: which basically just means a broad selection of all different businesses
[11:30 PM] fancy: because in general the economy grows
[11:30 PM] fancy: and if it doesn't you're fucked anyway
[11:30 PM] fancy: so you kinda just chill for a long ass time at like
[11:30 PM] fancy: 7%
[11:30 PM] fancy: which is pretty reasonable
[11:30 PM] fancy: and eventually you ahve retirement money
[11:30 PM] fancy: ez
[11:31 PM] A Random Badger: so you invest in funds just like a stock but also pay fees over time and then at some point sell it at the NAV price?
[11:31 PM] fancy: a fund is just a bunch of stocks
[11:31 PM] A Random Badger: and i imagine the whole point is yea you pay fees but ideally and commonly the nav price  increases to an amount that makes those fees look like nothing
[11:32 PM] fancy: there's also index funds
[11:32 PM] A Random Badger: i see
[11:32 PM] fancy: which are like
[11:32 PM] fancy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index
[11:32 PM] fancy: you can just invest in that
[11:32 PM] fancy: it has no fees
[11:32 PM] fancy: the other one is like uhh
[11:32 PM] fancy: I think nasdaq?
[11:33 PM] fancy: has an index fund too?
[11:33 PM] A Random Badger: oh
[11:33 PM] A Random Badger: i know what you mean
[11:33 PM] A Random Badger: i just read about it
[11:33 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[11:33 PM] fancy: yeah
[11:33 PM] fancy: index funds are bueno
[11:33 PM] A Random Badger: do you mean the DJIA?
[11:33 PM] A Random Badger: because it mentioned that along with the sp 500
[11:34 PM] A Random Badger: When people talk about the stock market, they often are actually referring to one of the major indices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) or the S&P 500.
[11:34 PM] fancy: that's the dow jones
[11:34 PM] A Random Badger: oh ok
[11:34 PM] fancy: also idk what that sentence mneans out of context lol
[11:34 PM] fancy: I've never heard someone referring to the stock markte that means that instead lol
[11:35 PM] fancy: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index
[11:35 PM] fancy: this is my home
[11:35 PM] A Random Badger: i just copy pasted it, this whole page was talking about how stocks trade
[11:35 PM] A Random Badger: this was the entire paragraph
[11:35 PM] A Random Badger: In addition to individual stocks, many investors are concerned with stock indices (also called indexes). Indices represent aggregated prices of a number of different stocks, and the movement of an index is the net effect of the movements of each individual component. When people talk about the stock market, they often are actually referring to one of the major indices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) or the S&P 500.
[11:35 PM] fancy: oh
[11:35 PM] fancy: yeah that makes a bit more sense but still eh
[11:36 PM] A Random Badger: this is some guide from investopedia
[11:36 PM] A Random Badger: just talking about basically how investing and stocks works and stuff
[11:36 PM] A Random Badger: not actually like how to invest so to speak
[11:36 PM] A Random Badger: ig
[11:36 PM] fancy: sure
[11:36 PM] A Random Badger: this was the thing i as looking at tho where i found this https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/5wl1w2/a_beginners_guide_to_investing/
[11:38 PM] fancy: oh yeah vanguard funds
[11:38 PM] fancy: those are dope too
[11:38 PM] fancy: but yeah this is more involved than most people need
[11:38 PM] fancy: tbh
[11:38 PM] A Random Badger: so you suggest i do the index fund investing?
[11:39 PM] A Random Badger: im looking at it now on this reddit thing
[11:39 PM] A Random Badger: under  the uh advice for young adults
[11:39 PM] A Random Badger: how to handle $
[11:39 PM] fancy: yeah
[11:39 PM] fancy: that's basically the important things
[11:39 PM] A Random Badger: i see
[11:39 PM] A Random Badger: ty
[11:39 PM] fancy: roth ira is like
[11:39 PM] A Random Badger: im glad we discussed this
[11:39 PM] fancy: the biggest meme if you can make it happen
[11:39 PM] fancy: cus you're limited to 5500 per year
[11:39 PM] fancy: but it's like
[11:39 PM] fancy: super fucking value
[11:40 PM] A Random Badger: roth ira?
[11:40 PM] fancy: yeah
[11:40 PM] fancy: it's a type of retirement account
[11:40 PM] fancy: that's not taxed at all
[11:40 PM] fancy: going in or coming out
[11:40 PM] fancy: regular ira's are taxed going in
[11:40 PM] A Random Badger: i see
[11:40 PM] A Random Badger: so how does that play into the index funds
[11:40 PM] fancy: “As an example, if a 20-year-old puts $5,000 a year into a Roth for 10 years and then stops contributing (because they make more than the phase-out amount or need a tax deduction of future contributions to a Traditional retirement account), the 10 years of Roth contributions and growth—let’s say at 8% interest a year to age 65—could total about $1,070,944 of tax-free dollars,” says Peter J. Creedon, CFP®, ChFC®, CLU®, chief executive officer, Crystal Brook Advisors, New York, N.Y.
[11:41 PM] A Random Badger: oh i see
[11:41 PM] fancy: it's a retirement investment account
[11:41 PM] fancy: so the money gets invested
[11:41 PM] fancy: and it's like
[11:41 PM] fancy: really easy to get 6% return after inflation
[11:41 PM] A Random Badger: so it grows like a normal index
[11:41 PM] fancy: just by investing in whatever index fund you feel like
[11:41 PM] A Random Badger: i see
[11:41 PM] fancy: with a little bit of management
[11:41 PM] A Random Badger: i thought this was literally just like
[11:41 PM] A Random Badger: a bank account
[11:41 PM] A Random Badger: xd
[11:41 PM] fancy: more or less
[11:41 PM] fancy: you just can't take stuff out until you're like
[11:41 PM] fancy: 65 or so
[11:42 PM] fancy: or there's penalties
[11:42 PM] A Random Badger: yea i see
[11:42 PM] fancy: or something
[11:42 PM] fancy: idr
[11:42 PM] fancy: exactly
[11:42 PM] A Random Badger: so i can put in like 5k every 10 years and just be fucking loaded potentially at 65
[11:42 PM] fancy: well
[11:42 PM] fancy: ideally
[11:42 PM] fancy: 5k every year
[11:42 PM] fancy: I have like 20k in mine rn
[11:42 PM] A Random Badger: oh every year
[11:42 PM] fancy: yeah
[11:42 PM] fancy: you are allowed to contribute like
[11:42 PM] A Random Badger: i saw the 10 year part and i though that was the limit
[11:43 PM] A Random Badger: my bad
[11:43 PM] fancy: 5500 every year as long as you don't make more than like
[11:43 PM] fancy: 120k
[11:43 PM] fancy: a year
[11:43 PM] fancy: or something
[11:43 PM] A Random Badger: i see
[11:43 PM] fancy: unless you earn less
[11:43 PM] fancy: that's another condition
[11:43 PM] fancy: it's 5500 or as much as you made that year
[11:43 PM] fancy: whichever is lower
[11:43 PM] A Random Badger: ah okay
[11:43 PM] A Random Badger: so like
[11:44 PM] A Random Badger: thisis great for retirement but
[11:44 PM] A Random Badger: what about short term money?
[11:44 PM] fancy: not reliable
[11:44 PM] A Random Badger: so i can like go to school and live comfortably
[11:44 PM] fancy: investing is super unreliable for anything short term
[11:44 PM] fancy: it's really really really hard to predict anything
[11:44 PM] fancy: unless you have inside info
[11:44 PM] fancy: which isn't allowed
[11:44 PM] A Random Badger: i see
[11:44 PM] fancy: so basically you would only do it with fun money
[11:44 PM] fancy: it's like
[11:44 PM] fancy: playing the lottery
[11:45 PM] A Random Badger: yea
[11:45 PM] fancy: except to earn anything significant you have to put in a bunch
[11:45 PM] fancy: which is risky
[11:45 PM] fancy: or you have to get really really lucky
[11:46 PM] A Random Badger: so basically if i want to at all live comfortably until my retirement investments kick in at 65, and also make enough to ideally put in 5k a year, i need to fuck embrace student loan debt cause me and my family are poor af and get a good education that hopefully has demand in the field i want 4 years down the line and can make money
[11:46 PM] fancy: pretty much
[11:46 PM] fancy: america kinda
[11:46 PM] fancy: sucks
[11:46 PM] fancy: because education is so expensive
[11:46 PM] fancy: and student loans are big time memes
[11:47 PM] fancy: you can't even dodge them with declaring bankruptcy
[11:47 PM] fancy: BECAUSE REASONS
[11:47 PM] fancy: imo the cheapest thing to do with the best ROI is to like
[11:47 PM] fancy: go learn a trade if you can
[11:47 PM] fancy: it's like a lot of hard work
[11:47 PM] fancy: but education for that is so much cheaper
[11:47 PM] fancy: and trades are in super demand
[11:47 PM] A Random Badger: ugh so no matter what life is just fucking, dice rolls and see if you get lucky lmao
[11:47 PM] fancy: cus it's really hard to automate that shit
[11:47 PM] fancy: well no
[11:47 PM] A Random Badger: yea
[11:47 PM] fancy: life is
[11:47 PM] fancy: work really hard
[11:48 PM] fancy: and all the time
[11:48 PM] fancy: and then die
[11:48 PM] A Random Badger: idk i still wanna go into engineering
[11:48 PM] fancy: that's very expensive and we have lots of people there so it's harder to stand out
[11:48 PM] A Random Badger: ugh
[11:49 PM] A Random Badger: 

[11:51 PM] A Random Badger: hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[11:51 PM] fancy: yeah
[11:51 PM] fancy: basically everything comes down to
[11:51 PM] fancy: you can't get anything without a butt load of effort
[11:51 PM] A Random Badger: and even then sometimes you just dont get the chance to do what you enjoy
[11:52 PM] fancy: sure
[11:52 PM] A Random Badger: seems like it
[11:52 PM] fancy: depends on your expectations(edited)
[11:53 PM] A Random Badger: i thought something engineering or maths was reasonable but i guess not, now im thinking it'll just end up being a wasted degree with what you said
[11:53 PM] A Random Badger: hmmmm
[11:53 PM] fancy: well it is
[11:53 PM] fancy: it's just
[11:53 PM] fancy: really expensive
[11:54 PM] fancy: and it's still a lot of work
[11:54 PM] fancy: but it pays well
[11:54 PM] fancy: when you get done with it all
[11:54 PM] fancy: assuming you find a job that you can stand doing
[11:55 PM] A Random Badger: options seem limited
[11:55 PM] A Random Badger: debt seems like the least of my concerns
[11:55 PM] fancy: well
[11:55 PM] fancy: it would become one of your biggest concerns
[11:56 PM] fancy: once you made it through and are like
[11:56 PM] fancy: fuck I have like 30-50k in loans
[11:56 PM] A Random Badger: it seems like the options are
[11:56 PM] A Random Badger: that
[11:56 PM] A Random Badger: or
[11:56 PM] A Random Badger: do something dumb
[11:56 PM] fancy: or learn a trade for a lot cheaper
[11:56 PM] A Random Badger: that i wont enjoy
[11:56 PM] fancy: or start a business
[11:56 PM] fancy: xd
[11:57 PM] A Random Badger: wishing i could've joined the military rn
[11:57 PM] fancy: ew
[11:57 PM] A Random Badger: free school would've been nice
[11:57 PM] fancy: sure if you have no morals
[11:58 PM] A Random Badger: i really wanted to be on a nuke sub and be an officer and do nuclear engineering
[11:58 PM] fancy: maybe
[11:58 PM] A Random Badger: i remember emailing this one teacher from another district that my engineering teacher knew who did it
[11:59 PM] A Random Badger: but shit happens ig
[11:59 PM] A Random Badger: someone didnt want that to happen
[11:59 PM] fancy: idk
July 9, 2018
[12:00 AM] A Random Badger: i wish i was born japanese or korea or chinese in a moderately wealthy family who sent me to a go academy for my entire childhood until i became a pro and then just played go my whole life and made moderate amounts of money from that
[12:00 AM] A Random Badger: that would've been the ideal life
[12:00 AM] fancy: perhaps
[12:01 AM] fancy: grass is always greener
[12:01 AM] fancy: you wouldn't be the person you are now if you were like that
[12:01 AM] fancy: maybe you don't even like go
[12:01 AM] A Random Badger: i think its so dumb
[12:01 AM] A Random Badger: like its some kinda of extraterrestrial taunt
[12:02 AM] A Random Badger: introducing us to stuff that we end up liking so much that is literally impossible to pursue
[12:02 AM] fancy: I mean
[12:02 AM] fancy: not sure I agree with that
[12:02 AM] A Random Badger: feels like life so far
[12:03 AM] fancy: sure
[12:03 AM] A Random Badger: idk what to do
[12:03 AM] A Random Badger: im depressed now
[12:03 AM] fancy: and you weren't before
[12:03 AM] A Random Badger: well i was moderately in a good mood prior to this
[12:04 AM] A Random Badger: especially with the whole investment conversation
[12:04 AM] A Random Badger: but now life seems futile
[12:05 AM] fancy: isn't it strange how things can change so quickly
[12:05 AM] fancy: almost as if it's all in your head
