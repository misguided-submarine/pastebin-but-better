[12:27 AM] A Random Badger: like to make
[12:27 AM] A Random Badger: sure
[12:27 AM] fancy: or something
[12:27 AM] A Random Badger: that it is known
[12:28 AM] fancy: why
[12:28 AM] fancy: so everyone knows
[12:28 AM] A Random Badger: by belittling thos epeople
[12:28 AM] fancy: that you're gonna fly off the handle
[12:28 AM] fancy: ?
[12:28 AM] fancy: that doesn't do anything but make you look like an irrational ass too tbh
[12:28 AM] fancy: I mean you see it happen to me
[12:28 AM] fancy: so
[12:28 AM] fancy: just keep that in mind
[12:29 AM] A Random Badger: it would be completely worth it in my mind if it meant that the person i just flew off the handle on felt reallly bad about themselves and decided to look upon themselves with embarrassment
[12:29 AM] fancy: they don't
[12:29 AM] A Random Badger: unfotunately
[12:29 AM] fancy: do you usually feel like you should change
[12:29 AM] fancy: when people yell at you
[12:29 AM] A Random Badger: they're usually too stubborn
[12:30 AM] fancy: or do you just redouble your commitment to your stance
[12:30 AM] fancy: yelling rarely ever helps anything
[12:30 AM] A Random Badger: depends on the person yelling at me
[12:30 AM] A Random Badger: but yes
[12:30 AM] A Random Badger: rarely
[12:30 AM] fancy: yeah
[12:31 AM] fancy: not worth your time
[12:31 AM] fancy: much higher success rate being calm
[12:31 AM] fancy: promise
[12:31 AM] fancy: :thumbsup:
[12:31 AM] A Random Badger: i personally just enjoy yelling at people and belittling them to the point they run out of words to use in response and then i use that as validation that i have won this round
[12:31 AM] fancy: won what
[12:31 AM] fancy: what did you win
[12:32 AM] fancy: you alienated someone
[12:32 AM] A Random Badger: e-penis points
[12:32 AM] fancy: is that what you want
[12:32 AM] fancy: is being right more important than being loved
[12:32 AM] A Random Badger: why would i want to be loved by someone i hate
[12:32 AM] fancy: why do you hate everyone
[12:32 AM] A Random Badger: i dont
[12:32 AM] A Random Badger: hate is a strong word
[12:32 AM] fancy: then why give them the satisfaction of wasting any thoughts on them
[12:33 AM] fancy: "There's no such thing as bad press"
[12:33 AM] fancy: is a saying for a reason
[12:33 AM] A Random Badger: idek what that saying means
[12:33 AM] A Random Badger: i think
[12:33 AM] fancy: It's a thing from celebrity culture
[12:33 AM] fancy: All attention is good attention
[12:33 AM] fancy: for the most part
[12:34 AM] fancy: drama sells
[12:34 AM] A Random Badger: ah yes
[12:34 AM] A Random Badger: that is
[12:34 AM] A Random Badger: if the person in question doesnt just embarass the shit out of you in front of everyone
[12:34 AM] A Random Badger: then i wouldnt call that good attention
[12:34 AM] A Random Badger: unless
[12:34 AM] A Random Badger: maybe
[12:34 AM] A Random Badger: you were a celebrity
[12:35 AM] A Random Badger: whjo could sell that
[12:35 AM] fancy: depends on the severity
[12:35 AM] fancy: even if you're embarrassed that sells anyway
[12:35 AM] fancy: more people that know your name the better
[12:35 AM] fancy: but yeah
[12:36 AM] A Random Badger: uh ig if you were a celebrity and made money off people literally just knowing your name but idk if that applies to the common folk
[12:37 AM] fancy: it does
[12:37 AM] fancy: don't waste time on people that aren't worth it
[12:37 AM] fancy: not worth the brainpower
[12:37 AM] fancy: I'd rather think about nice things
[12:37 AM] fancy: like cheese
[12:38 AM] A Random Badger: ig but potentially ruining even just the day of someone you really hate sounds ncie too
[12:38 AM] fancy: why
[12:38 AM] fancy: what do you gain from that
[12:38 AM] A Random Badger: just satisfaction in a sense that you just served them what they deserved
[12:39 AM] A Random Badger: i mean
[12:39 AM] A Random Badger: what do you gain from thinking of cheese lol
[12:39 AM] fancy: I like eating cheese
[12:39 AM] fancy: so I eat cheese
[12:39 AM] fancy: I don't waste time inflicting suffering
[12:39 AM] fancy: for the hell of it
[12:39 AM] fancy: they're not going to think that they deserved it
[12:39 AM] fancy: they're not gonna learn
[12:39 AM] fancy: they're just gonna think you're a dick
[12:40 AM] fancy: there's no point
[12:40 AM] fancy: you're just adding more bad to the world
[12:40 AM] fancy: for no reason
[12:40 AM] A Random Badger: ig youre right
