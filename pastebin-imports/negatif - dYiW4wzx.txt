ez

[10:44 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	pizza is too lax on people lol, he almost let bread and davi be cores
	and then he still let someone play chen

[10:44 PM]
공상:
	l u l
	chen is just
	not really a hero
	neither is sven
	that game was a large issue of
	ur win condition hero not being good
	liquid had that problem too
	when tehy last picked ck
	that one game

[10:44 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	i just don't even know, i don't know if you saw the side lanes
	but lion left and minute 2
	and never came back
	and chen was almost always in the jungle

[10:45 PM]
공상:
	he came middle
	to
	uh

[10:45 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	once

[10:45 PM]
공상:
	boop me

[10:45 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	but then kept roaming

[10:45 PM]
공상:
	he came middle some other times

[10:45 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	the mid gank was fine
	but he just never came back
	after mid he went bot

[10:45 PM]
공상:
	the mid gank was like
	not even good
	tbh
	it was a waste of time

[10:45 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	no not really
	people just don't get the overall
	i just cannot  believe we got outdone by redman
	feels....bad.....man

[10:46 PM]
공상:
	I mean
	you got out done
	by
	me microing everyone
	to use the map better

[10:46 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	i feel i was already titlted, i played a game with lach, davi, jay and bread earlier
	we had 1 racks left and they had not taken any racks
	and we lost
	yeah it was definitely captaining, i couldn't believe redman had the sense to do what he was doing
	on our side pizza would say something and chen would blatantly go in the other direction
	i don't know...

[10:47 PM]
공상:
	he didn't
	have the sense
	i was like
	okay
	you back now

[10:47 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	and chen and weaver were both nonexistant that game

[10:47 PM]
공상:
	sven has been gone for 9 seconds
	he can be here

[10:48 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	honestly i told pizza we just need to immediately ban brood, alch and meepo

[10:48 PM]
공상:
	that's
	also not a good play
	tbh

[10:48 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	i feel like any hero that changes the game that much is just annoying

[10:48 PM]
공상:
	I mean annoying sure

[10:49 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	yeah but if you don't get a hero that can alter the whole game

[10:49 PM]
공상:
	but all those heroes have problems

[10:49 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	what is your team going to do

[10:49 PM]
공상:
	like if you pick tiny I can't pick brood or meepo

[10:49 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	yeah but they waste time
	and people are dumb
	i'd rather deal with tinker
	or storm

[10:49 PM]
공상:
	if you pick ursa I can't pick alch if it's in my lane

[10:49 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	or heroes you can itemise against
	yes well we aren't drafting amazingly as you might notice from the past 30 gmes
	lol
	and that's assuming you don't just outclass the ursa player
	imagine if it was davi
	i doubt he'd be an issue

[10:50 PM]
공상:
	mb
	but I win mos tlanes no matter what
	but like
	if I have a hero that can't fight them

[10:50 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	eaxctly, so better a lina than a brood

[10:50 PM]
공상:
	then we lose
	I mean
	brood was pretty bad that game
	like my hero was super useless
	cus of how the lane went

[10:50 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	yeah but the amount of time we spent chasing it

[10:51 PM]
공상:
	and then u all hunted me
	forever

[10:51 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	exacxtly

[10:51 PM]
공상:
	but like we still lose
	if I don't tell everyone how to play teh game

[10:51 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	i try, but i probably just come off sounding annoyed
	because i am
	and our team just wasn't listening
	davi was complaining about being destoryed even though he harped on and on about how good bread was on chen
	like c'mon mate.... you must know you're basically solo if you want a chen
	i honestly cannot recall a single impactful moment from the chen that game

[10:52 PM]
공상:
	i got
	penitenced
	once

[10:52 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	half the time i looked he was jungle farming

[10:52 PM]
공상:
	maybe twice

[10:52 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	saying he had to gather creeps lol

[10:52 PM]
공상:
	lul

[10:53 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	and all the whining from davi is probably why lion left my lane
	i don't know why people don't realise leaving winning lanes to salvagelosing ones is never a good idea

[10:53 PM]
공상:
	I finally taught redman
	it took
	2 years
	xD

[10:53 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	i told him all he has to do is hex the bs when he is raged and come up for a last hit
	we had him sub 20% hp the first 2 min
	and he wasn't even last hitting
	i know you don't like zeus v bs but i was destroying him early

[10:54 PM]
공상:
	yeah he's also bad

[10:54 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	but then he got rupture and i was solo so.... him and phoenix owned me lol

[10:54 PM]
공상:
	who knew
	xD

[10:54 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	whatever, it is what it is
	we need a new way to pick teams though lol

[10:54 PM]
공상:
	I mean

[10:54 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	the EU practice does something else

[10:54 PM]
공상:
	I need
	to sit out
	honestly

[10:55 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	where's the enjoyment from trying to end the streak then

[10:55 PM]
공상:
	I mean
	idn
	I thought we were talking abuot
	wait
	do you mean like
	the enjoyment for you guys
	to try to end my streak?

[10:57 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	lol, i don't think anyone is that invested, but it would be satisfying somewhat

[10:57 PM]
공상:
	or were you talking about
	the enjoyment for me to try to lose xD

[10:57 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	oh lol
	no

[10:57 PM]
공상:
	ah
	yeah
	like
	you'd all have to commit
	to like
	being super serious

[10:58 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	i think we just give you and the worst direction takers
	regardless of skill
	and we get the ones who can follow orders

[10:58 PM]
공상:
	LOL

[10:58 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	and don't demand stupid effing heroes

[10:58 PM]
공상:
	I'm not sure
	if those people exist
	but yeah if we were interested in balance
	we have two options
	get my friend nikki to play
	or
	i sit out
	lol

[10:58 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	lol
	alright, let me talk to her about our plight

[10:58 PM]
공상:
	xD

[10:59 PM]
TAW | Negatif:
	maybe the meta will finally change as well
	and laning will not matter as much
	i really cannot stand it atm, your support leaves for 2 seconds
	and your lane is lost
	or in this case, lion was just walking on the opposite side of the trees to me
	i just don't know
	anyway gtg dinner
	see ya
