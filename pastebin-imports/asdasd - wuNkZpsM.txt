bani:
	are you still mad at me/ignoring me

[6:02 PM]
공상:
	what part of bye was confusing to you

[6:02 PM]
bani:
	i don't understand what you want from me then

[6:03 PM]
공상:
	what do you mean
	I don't want anything from you ?

[6:05 PM]
bani:
	you don't want to be my friend anymore because i went to couple's counseling with jeff so you ignore me and demote me in your server
	when you went through bad times did your friend start ignoring you too

[6:06 PM]
공상:
	Do you not remember when I told you that if you made this decision I would unfriend you
	I think you're making ar eally really foolish decision and I can't watch someone go through this again
	it's not worth risking
	I'm not enabling bad decisions
	and you knew this would happen because you didn't tell me about it, so I know you thought I wouldn't approve of it

[6:07 PM]
bani:
	that's fine, you don't have to agree with my decisions
	why didn't you just unfriend me and kick me from your server then instead of this passive aggressive bullshit

[6:08 PM]
공상:
	because I'm not removing you from everyone else
	everyone else is still willing to talk to you and be friends with you
	but I can't
	I have to protect myself first
	and I havent' written you off for the entirety of time

[6:09 PM]
bani:
	only when it's convenient for you

[6:09 PM]
공상:
	I don't think it's passive aggressive, seeing as I told you this would happen
	bani you didn't know me when I dealt with that shit
	I don't want to go through it again I barely made it through the first time
	I'm not watching someone I care about go through that shit
	when they could just not
	when I'm telling them not to
	You make it seem like I'm not willing to support you any more
	like, at all
	I'm willing to support you
	but you're making a decision
	completely opposite to what It hink you should do
	I have no advice in this situation
	anything you bring to me
	is just going to be answered by
	"you shouldn't be doing this"
	this is like your mom telling you not to go out drinking every night, then you deciding to do it anyway, then asking her for advice on how to cure hangovers
	the answer is dont' get drunk
	I don't have anythign else for you
	but I can't go through another indeterminate amount of months with you being sad about Jeff
	because I know all those feelings
	and I don't want to go through that again
	It's like watching someone drink themselves to death
	in the end it's a decision your'e making and nothign I do will change your mind
	what would you do in my position
