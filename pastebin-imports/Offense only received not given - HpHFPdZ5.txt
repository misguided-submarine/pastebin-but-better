9:04 PM - A Random Badger: it was not meant to upset you
9:04 PM - A Random Badger: ig
9:04 PM - A Random Badger: idk
9:04 PM - fancy: ah
9:05 PM - fancy: yeah you missed the not
9:05 PM - fancy: but okay
9:05 PM - fancy: soi
9:05 PM - A Random Badger: oh i missed the not
9:05 PM - A Random Badger: yea
9:05 PM - fancy: are you aware that I don't generally think being intentionally dumb is funny
9:05 PM - fancy: you should be because I've told you this
9:05 PM - fancy: i've also said that i find it very upsetting
9:05 PM - fancy: and annoying
9:05 PM - fancy: mostly annoying
9:06 PM - A Random Badger: my bad ig? but i have simply always been like that so it was never something i was just going to easily stop doing
9:07 PM - fancy: so back to what I said earlier, about intent not mattering
9:07 PM - fancy: so now the end result is I'm just annoyed
9:07 PM - fancy: and you're just okay with this?
9:08 PM - A Random Badger: that seems like a loaded question
9:08 PM - A Random Badger: that begins to imply that there exists memes and jokes that should simply never be spoken due to the possibility of upsetting someone
9:10 PM - fancy: well, it depends
9:10 PM - fancy: is your goal to upset people?
9:10 PM - A Random Badger: no lol
9:10 PM - fancy: okay, so, in the case that you do upset someone, does it make more sense to say, "oops, my b", and then try not to do that thign again, or to continue doing it because "they just shouldn't be upset because this is just how i am"
9:11 PM - A Random Badger: my only goal with my jokes and memes have always and forever will be to attempt to get people to laugh
9:11 PM - A Random Badger: i dont think there is a right or wrong answer to that
9:12 PM - fancy: there is, depending on your goal
9:12 PM - A Random Badger: it expects one side or the other to bend to the will of another
9:12 PM - fancy: not really, this is just common social courtesy
9:12 PM - fancy: which, I guess, yeah
9:12 PM - fancy: you're kinda bending to the will of others in a sense
9:12 PM - fancy: but that's the fundamental building block of society
9:12 PM - fancy: we all have to refrain from doing things to get along with other people
9:13 PM - fancy: the other option is subsistence farming alone
9:13 PM - fancy: quick aside
9:13 PM - fancy: before we get back tot his
9:13 PM - fancy: you can type out your thoughts first I guess
9:15 PM - A Random Badger: uh i was just gonna say that i dont think that is inherently true due to the fact that there is a widely different beleif about this on a political level between conservatives and liberals. one side would expect you to refraind from doing things to get along with other people another side would encouurages you to be you until you found people who accepted you for those aspects
9:15 PM - fancy: okay so
9:15 PM - fancy: quick aside
9:15 PM - fancy: do you agree that offense cannot be given
9:15 PM - fancy: only received
9:16 PM - A Random Badger: yes
9:16 PM - fancy: okay
9:16 PM - A Random Badger: well
9:16 PM - A Random Badger: um
9:16 PM - A Random Badger: hm
9:16 PM - A Random Badger: maybe no
9:16 PM - fancy: why not?
9:16 PM - A Random Badger: i think you can deliberatly do things to offend someone
9:16 PM - fancy: right
9:16 PM - fancy: but if they are not offended
9:16 PM - fancy: what effect does that have?
9:16 PM - fancy: considering intent doesn't really matter
9:17 PM - A Random Badger: if they're not offended it simply wont have an effect
9:17 PM - fancy: right
9:17 PM - fancy: so
9:17 PM - fancy: can it be given if it's not received?
9:18 PM - A Random Badger: yes tho perhaps the way im thinking there is another words for it other than offense
9:18 PM - fancy: you can try to offend someone, sure
9:18 PM - fancy: but you can't make them be offended
9:18 PM - A Random Badger: yes
9:19 PM - A Random Badger: on the flip side however
9:19 PM - A Random Badger: just because it was received doesn't mean it was given
9:19 PM - fancy: right
9:19 PM - fancy: but it was still taken
9:19 PM - fancy: so
9:19 PM - fancy: offense is only received, not given
9:19 PM - fancy: yes?
9:20 PM - A Random Badger: sure, its the intent that makes the difference i guess
9:20 PM - fancy: but intent doesn't matter, no?
9:20 PM - A Random Badger: i think in this case it does
