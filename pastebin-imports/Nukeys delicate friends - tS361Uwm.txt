[10:40 PM] fancy: i did
[10:40 PM] fancy: I'm a rude person
[10:40 PM] Nukey: Please don't be rude to the people in my stack though
[10:40 PM] fancy: who did I even flame this time
[10:41 PM] Nukey: Everyone basically xd
[10:41 PM] fancy: uh
[10:41 PM] fancy: sure
[10:41 PM] fancy: I mean if you can't even say anything I said
[10:41 PM] fancy: then I mean
[10:41 PM] fancy: idkw hat you want me to do
[10:41 PM] fancy: so
[10:42 PM] Nukey: You called people retards
[10:42 PM] Nukey: And
[10:42 PM] fancy: I flamed you when you missed powershots
[10:42 PM] fancy: xd
[10:42 PM] Nukey: Something along the lines of no one knows how to lane
[10:42 PM] fancy: i mean that's just a fact
[10:42 PM] Nukey: Well yea
[10:42 PM] Nukey: But still rude
[10:42 PM] fancy: I guess
[10:42 PM] fancy: if you have like
[10:42 PM] fancy: a super fragile pscyhe
[10:42 PM] Nukey: People got upset
[10:43 PM] fancy: yeah they like to throw shade and they can't take it
[10:43 PM] fancy: it's why I don't get along with them
[10:44 PM] fancy: they've been super rude to me constantly so
[10:44 PM] fancy: I don't really give them much consideration any more
[10:44 PM] fancy: and I don't think I'm gonna buy the "well don't flame my friends because they're my friends" thing
[10:45 PM] fancy: especially when it's that mild of a comment
[10:45 PM] fancy: "retard" is thrown around so much lol
[10:45 PM] Nukey: [02:42] +Shik_shin: i mean
[02:42] +Shik_shin: clearly no one on this team
[02:42] +Shik_shin: knows how to lane
[02:42] +Shik_shin: so he's just gonna sit there and abuse the retards
[10:45 PM] fancy: yeah
[10:45 PM] fancy: that's like
[10:45 PM] fancy: so mild lol wtf
[10:45 PM] fancy: if you get upset over that you're beyond help
[10:45 PM] Nukey: its pretty rude
[10:46 PM] fancy: sure
[10:46 PM] fancy: way less rude than anything they've ever done to me so
[10:46 PM] fancy: I don't think it's fair to call me out on that
[10:47 PM] fancy: that also included the void
[10:47 PM] fancy: who wasn't in your stack
[10:47 PM] fancy: so
[10:47 PM] Nukey: i mean
[10:47 PM] Nukey: i only sadi something cus bob said he got tilted
[10:47 PM] fancy: it's just a generic insult to people that are bad at dota
[10:47 PM] fancy: nathan gets tilted by everything
[10:47 PM] Nukey: but i mean
[10:47 PM] Nukey: theres just no reason to say those things
[10:47 PM] fancy: it's true
[10:47 PM] fancy: you were complaining about the bristle getting everything
[10:47 PM] fancy: and Im like yeah
[10:47 PM] fancy: he just sat in his lane and abused retards
[10:48 PM] fancy: if some 7k player called my play retarded
[10:48 PM] fancy: I'd be like
[10:48 PM] fancy: sure
[10:48 PM] fancy: I'm bad
[10:49 PM] fancy: but getting upset over that seems like you just have no self awareness
[10:50 PM] fancy: or you have a really fragile ego and no confidence
[10:50 PM] fancy: both of which aren't really my problem
[10:50 PM] fancy: if one of my friends was like
[10:50 PM] fancy: hey
[10:50 PM] fancy: dont' do that it bothers me
[10:50 PM] fancy: I'd be like sure okay
[10:50 PM] fancy: but if someone who has treated me like he has says it
[10:50 PM] fancy: I just don't really care what his feelings are any more
[10:51 PM] fancy: reciprocation works both ways
[10:51 PM] Nukey: well
[10:51 PM] Nukey: it bothers me
[10:52 PM] fancy: what bothers you
[10:52 PM] fancy: cus nothing they ever to me bothered you
[10:52 PM] fancy: so
[10:52 PM] Nukey: that you're being rude to people in my stack and saying it to their face
[10:52 PM] fancy: I don't know if I buy that
[10:52 PM] Nukey: Well they're not saying it to your face
[10:52 PM] Nukey: like
[10:52 PM] Nukey: they dont go into the chat
[10:52 PM] Nukey: and say "lol fancy u suck a big back of dicks"
[10:52 PM] fancy: lol why does that matter
[10:53 PM] fancy: I'd be like lol sure
[10:53 PM] fancy: cus I like
[10:53 PM] fancy: have self worth
[10:53 PM] fancy: i'd rather someone be rude to my face than behind my back
[10:53 PM] fancy: which is what they liked to do
[10:53 PM] Nukey: like
[10:53 PM] Nukey: i dont really know what happened
[10:53 PM] Nukey: but if you dont go into chat saying rude stuff about thme i dont think they would ahve gotten upset
[10:54 PM] fancy: okay?
[10:54 PM] fancy: sure?
[10:54 PM] fancy: I'm not sure what your point is tho
[10:54 PM] Nukey: i just asked you not to
[10:54 PM] fancy: yeah but why should I care
[10:54 PM] Nukey: well geez
[10:54 PM] Nukey: because im asking you nicely?
[10:55 PM] fancy: to which I said that
[10:55 PM] fancy: it seems strange that you care now
[10:55 PM] fancy: and you didn't before
[10:55 PM] fancy: if people do retarded shit I'm going to call it retarded I mean that's just life
[10:55 PM] fancy: call a spade a spade
[10:58 PM] fancy: like if it really bothers you i'll just stop saying anything when I watch
[10:58 PM] fancy: but I still think it's really odd that you care now
[10:59 PM] Nukey: like wtf
[10:59 PM] Nukey: how do you find it so odd i just dont want my stack getting tilted
[10:59 PM] fancy: multiple reasons
[10:59 PM] Nukey: its also just a pretty rude thing to say
[11:00 PM] fancy: I would disagree but sure
[11:00 PM] fancy: but you never cared before when it was them doing it to me
[11:00 PM] fancy: and also
[11:00 PM] Nukey: when
[11:00 PM] fancy: way back when I used to be allowed to play with you guys
[11:00 PM] fancy: but I also think that
[11:00 PM] fancy: it's pandering to them because they can't be real adults
[11:01 PM] fancy: "wah i can't read mean things about me that are true without having a hissy fit cus I'm totally super well adjusted"
[11:01 PM] fancy: I think that's a really fucking dumb mentality lol
[11:01 PM] fancy: like actually laughable
[11:01 PM] Nukey: well yea
[11:02 PM] fancy: and I think enabling that is kinda odd
[11:02 PM] fancy: that's all
[11:02 PM] Nukey: you're blowing it out of proportions
[11:02 PM] fancy: I think if you were in my position you'd find it hard to not view those guys really really badly
[11:02 PM] Nukey: i litearlly just asked you
[11:02 PM] Nukey: not to be rude
[11:02 PM] Nukey: in chat
[11:02 PM] Nukey: like sure
[11:03 PM] Nukey: you may hate htem
[11:03 PM] fancy: I mean I was rude to the void
[11:03 PM] Nukey: but its still pretty rude
[11:03 PM] fancy: is that okay?
[11:03 PM] Nukey: yea
[11:03 PM] fancy: what about that tiny
[11:03 PM] fancy: okay that doesn't make any sense
[11:03 PM] fancy: lol
[11:03 PM] fancy: that's all I'm saying
[11:03 PM] Nukey: well
[11:03 PM] Nukey: maybe not void
[11:03 PM] Nukey: but tiny
[11:03 PM] Nukey: yea
[11:03 PM] Nukey: void was just
[11:03 PM] Nukey: bad
[11:03 PM] Nukey: and yea
[11:03 PM] Nukey: it makes sense
[11:03 PM] Nukey: because they're not in the fucking chat
[11:03 PM] fancy: and yoru stack is also just
[11:03 PM] fancy: bad
[11:03 PM] Nukey: reading what you're saying aobut them
[11:03 PM] fancy: lol
[11:03 PM] fancy: so because they decide
[11:03 PM] fancy: to also watch your stream
[11:03 PM] fancy: while playing
[11:03 PM] fancy: what if the void decided to watch
[11:04 PM] fancy: can you see how this isn't consistent?
[11:04 PM] Nukey: ok
[11:04 PM] Nukey: we both know
[11:04 PM] Nukey: void isnt gonna wathc my stream
[11:04 PM] Nukey: wtf
[11:04 PM] fancy: no
[11:04 PM] Nukey: how is that a point
[11:04 PM] fancy: that's not an argument
[11:04 PM] fancy: they could just not watch the stream too
[11:04 PM] fancy: they have a game to play anyway
[11:04 PM] fancy: they'd probably benefit way more from not trying to watch than just having a nice empty chat
[11:05 PM] Nukey: yea, so?
[11:05 PM] Nukey: thats up for them to decide
[11:05 PM] Nukey: like
[11:05 PM] fancy: it's up to them to read chat and get upset or not
[11:05 PM] Nukey: you're being pretty childish
[11:05 PM] fancy: not really?
[11:05 PM] Nukey: you're basically just saying
[11:05 PM] fancy: I think they're the ones being childish
[11:05 PM] fancy: lol
[11:05 PM] Nukey: "they were rude to me so i can be rude back to them"
[11:05 PM] fancy: no
[11:05 PM] fancy: I'm saying
[11:06 PM] Nukey: well yea but you're being too
[11:06 PM] fancy: beign rude isn't a big deal
[11:06 PM] fancy: and I dont' see why I have to censor myself
[11:06 PM] fancy: to make them feel better
[11:06 PM] Nukey: i really
[11:06 PM] Nukey: dont want to waste more time discussing this
[11:06 PM] fancy: also where was all this defense when it was me
[11:06 PM] fancy: like that's the part I can't understand
[11:06 PM] fancy: this is just teh same thing you've always done
[11:06 PM] fancy: you rationalize their shit
[11:06 PM] fancy: and condemn mine
[11:06 PM] fancy: I think that's really silly
[11:07 PM] Nukey: i dont know what you mean "when it was me"
[11:07 PM] fancy: they used to do all sorts of rude things to me
[11:07 PM] fancy: nathan single handedly decided I got to be excluded from playing games with everyone
[11:07 PM] fancy: steve pulled the most colossally dick move i've ever had anyone do to me
[11:08 PM] fancy: I don't remember any time you've ever defended me for anything but you defend them all the time, and that just seems strange to me
[11:08 PM] Nukey: like
[11:08 PM] Nukey: wtf
[11:08 PM] fancy: because to me, what they're doing clearly makes no sense
[11:08 PM] Nukey: what did steve do
[11:08 PM] fancy: what
[11:08 PM] fancy: like
[11:08 PM] fancy: we got into some dumb argument over somethign really trivial
[11:08 PM] fancy: and it was just like
[11:08 PM] Nukey: Also i dont think nathan single handely decided to exclude you from games
[11:08 PM] fancy: he did
[11:08 PM] fancy: okay hold on
[11:08 PM] Nukey: i just remember it as him not wanting to play with you
[11:08 PM] fancy: yeah and literally everyone took his side
[11:08 PM] fancy: and excluded me
[11:08 PM] fancy: when I had no problems with him
[11:09 PM] fancy: he's the one that decided he didn't want to play wtih me
[11:09 PM] fancy: but somehow I got the entire short end of that stick
[11:09 PM] fancy: which, I mean, sure
[11:09 PM] fancy: that's a decision you're all free to make
[11:09 PM] fancy: however, that's going to affect my perception of everyone lol
[11:10 PM] fancy: and the steve thing
[11:10 PM] fancy: we were giving each other shit for something
[11:10 PM] fancy: some like
[11:10 PM] fancy: really meaningless argument
[11:10 PM] fancy: that like
[11:10 PM] fancy: clearly wasn't about anything
[11:10 PM] fancy: and he just goes full fucking nuclear
[11:10 PM] fancy: and is like
[11:10 PM] fancy: "well at least I wasn't the one crying to me every night about his gf dumping him"
[11:10 PM] fancy: and it's like
[11:10 PM] fancy: fucking hell wtf
[11:11 PM] Nukey: yea okay
[11:11 PM] fancy: everyone knows I'm really sensitive about that
[11:11 PM] Nukey: wtf
[11:11 PM] fancy: and that I had ar eally really hard time wiht it
[11:11 PM] fancy: like I can find
[11:11 PM] Nukey: i dont remember tha happening
[11:11 PM] Nukey: i dont think i was there
[11:11 PM] fancy: the argument
[11:11 PM] Nukey: you dont need to
[11:11 PM] fancy: but like
[11:11 PM] fancy: yeah
[11:11 PM] Nukey: but yea
[11:11 PM] fancy: so I litearlly dont' care if steve ends up as a hobo
[11:11 PM] fancy: cus I really trusted him
[11:11 PM] fancy: and he just fuckign
[11:11 PM] fancy: shows he gives no actual fucks
[11:11 PM] Nukey: hes pretty childish
[11:12 PM] fancy: yeah
[11:12 PM] fancy: he likes to talk shit
[11:12 PM] fancy: and can't take it at all
[11:12 PM] fancy: neither could hopes
[11:12 PM] fancy: which is why i couldn't stand him
[11:12 PM] fancy: neither could nathan
[11:12 PM] fancy: jason was whatever he's just high all the time
[11:13 PM] Nukey: yea okay steve was pretty childish
[11:13 PM] Nukey: but like
[11:13 PM] fancy: like if I got upset when you call me a nerd
[11:13 PM] fancy: wouldn't you think that makes no sense
[11:13 PM] Nukey: yea
[11:13 PM] Nukey: but hear me out
[11:13 PM] fancy: okay go
[11:13 PM] Nukey: so you say i didnt defend you with the bob/steve thing
[11:13 PM] Nukey: like
[11:14 PM] Nukey: what could i even do
[11:14 PM] Nukey: i cant just make
[11:14 PM] Nukey: them play with you
[11:14 PM] fancy: did you ever say hey don't be rude to fancy(edited)
[11:14 PM] Nukey: if they dont want to
[11:14 PM] Nukey: i didnt even know the steve thing happened
[11:14 PM] fancy: you didn't play with me either after that
[11:14 PM] Nukey: and i did ask why they didnt wanna play with you
[11:14 PM] fancy: unless no one else was around
[11:14 PM] Nukey: i wanted a stack xd
[11:15 PM] Nukey: also
[11:15 PM] Nukey: the actual point
[11:15 PM] Nukey: and its gonna sound like im condeming you again
[11:15 PM] Nukey: but tbh
[11:15 PM] Nukey: you should maybe think about what went wrong in all those relationships
[11:15 PM] Nukey: because i dont think i know anyone that has burned as many bridges as you
[11:15 PM] fancy: I have really high standards for people
[11:15 PM] fancy: I don't put up with shit
[11:16 PM] Nukey: waow
[11:16 PM] Nukey: im honored
[11:17 PM] Nukey: like
[11:17 PM] fancy: he also refused to talk about it then
[11:17 PM] Nukey: you didnt phase him out because of your standards
[11:17 PM] fancy: so I couldn't even work it out
[11:17 PM] fancy: if I wanted to
[11:18 PM] fancy: I remember asking
[11:18 PM] fancy: ashley
[11:18 PM] fancy: and she was like yeah he doesn't really want to
[11:18 PM] fancy: so I was like okay then
[11:18 PM] Nukey: my point is
[11:18 PM] Nukey: he ended the relation ship
[11:18 PM] Nukey: not you
[11:18 PM] fancy: yeah cus I yelled at him all the time
[11:18 PM] fancy: cus he annoyed me
[11:18 PM] fancy: and I wasn't very fun to play dota with either
[11:18 PM] Nukey: have you tried
[11:18 PM] Nukey: not doing that
[11:18 PM] fancy: cus they didnt' want to win
[11:18 PM] Nukey: lmao
[11:19 PM] fancy: and I did
[11:19 PM] fancy: uh no
[11:19 PM] fancy: cus I don't like being annoyed
[11:19 PM] fancy: I'd rather be friends with people that don't annoy me
[11:19 PM] fancy: like I could decide to put up with more
[11:19 PM] fancy: and be nicer
[11:19 PM] fancy: and like
[11:19 PM] Nukey: ok
[11:20 PM] fancy: not say how I really feel
[11:20 PM] fancy: but like
[11:20 PM] fancy: I don't really want to be like that, it's not worth the trade off
[11:20 PM] fancy: I don't tell people things just because that's what they want to hear,
[11:20 PM] fancy: at least in my personal life
[11:20 PM] Nukey: yea
[11:20 PM] fancy: I think people who do that are really scummy
[11:20 PM] Nukey: yea
[11:20 PM] Nukey: i agree
[11:21 PM] Nukey: i just think you should try conveying your message in a nicer way
[11:21 PM] fancy: I mean I could do that
[11:21 PM] fancy: but like
[11:21 PM] fancy: you think they're going to get less offended by  "abusing bad players" than "abusing retards"
[11:21 PM] fancy: I don't think so, not in my experience
[11:22 PM] Nukey: i'd defeintely get less offended by that
[11:22 PM] Nukey: or something like
[11:22 PM] Nukey: "abusing bad matchup"
[11:22 PM] fancy: but pugna void owns bristle
[11:22 PM] Nukey: what
[11:22 PM] fancy: there's no positive way to spin this
[11:22 PM] Nukey: really
[11:22 PM] fancy: yes
[11:22 PM] fancy: really
[11:22 PM] Nukey: void
[11:22 PM] Nukey: yea
[11:22 PM] Nukey: pugna
[11:22 PM] Nukey: how?
[11:22 PM] fancy: what
[11:22 PM] fancy: in lane?
[11:22 PM] Nukey: doesnt he just turn around
[11:22 PM] fancy: really easy
[11:23 PM] fancy: no
[11:23 PM] fancy: level 1
[11:23 PM] fancy: you just
[11:23 PM] fancy: bully him
[11:23 PM] fancy: with your 95 mana 9 billion damage thing
[11:23 PM] fancy: and then you control lane
[11:23 PM] fancy: and he's level 1 forever
[11:23 PM] fancy: bristle is so weak at level 1 and 2
[11:23 PM] fancy: he's only strong at 3
[11:23 PM] fancy: but since they're bad
[11:23 PM] fancy: they just
[11:23 PM] fancy: give him levels
[11:23 PM] fancy: and tehn feed
[11:23 PM] fancy: because they don't think about the game at all
[11:23 PM] Nukey: yea
[11:23 PM] fancy: because they don't care
[11:23 PM] fancy: which I think is a retarded mentality
[11:24 PM] Nukey: people care about videogames to varying degrees
[11:24 PM] fancy: I think doing a video game that the only goal is to win in
[11:24 PM] fancy: and not caring about winning
[11:24 PM] fancy: is really dumb
[11:24 PM] Nukey: they prolly care
[11:24 PM] Nukey: just not to the same degree
[11:24 PM] Nukey: or in the same way
[11:24 PM] fancy: they care
[11:24 PM] Nukey: they dont care in the way
[11:24 PM] fancy: okay so like
[11:24 PM] fancy: let me explain why I found them so frustrating
[11:24 PM] Nukey: "what am i gonna do instead"
[11:24 PM] fancy: they "care" about winning
[11:24 PM] fancy: insofar as
[11:25 PM] fancy: they get really mad when they lose
[11:25 PM] fancy: except
[11:25 PM] fancy: they're unwilling to do anything at all
[11:25 PM] fancy: that would improve their chances at winning
[11:25 PM] fancy: that was my experience(edited)
[11:25 PM] fancy: which just makes no sense
[11:25 PM] fancy: this was back when we played all the time
[11:25 PM] fancy: so it wasn'te ven somethign where
[11:25 PM] fancy: they did it an hour a week
[11:25 PM] fancy: and were like eh
[11:25 PM] fancy: they got so irrationally mad
[11:25 PM] fancy: for how much they invested
[11:26 PM] fancy: which I think is super immature and childish and really really annoying when I'm tryign really hard every game since I started dota
[11:26 PM] Nukey: Yea
[11:26 PM] Nukey: you just dont have the same goals lol
[11:26 PM] fancy: I'd be okay with that
[11:26 PM] fancy: if they hadn't complained so fucking much
[11:26 PM] fancy: about losing
[11:26 PM] fancy: nathan especially
[11:27 PM] fancy: would get SO MAD
[11:27 PM] fancy: when things went badly
[11:27 PM] fancy: it was really really annoying to me
[11:27 PM] fancy: and when i get annoyed I yell at people
[11:27 PM] Nukey: i mean
[11:27 PM] Nukey: is it a bad thing you stopped playing with them then?
[11:27 PM] fancy: no
[11:27 PM] fancy: it's not
[11:27 PM] fancy: i wouldn't go back lol
[11:28 PM] fancy: that wasn't my point though
[11:28 PM] fancy: I've stopped playing with tons of people since then
[11:29 PM] fancy: trying to find people who want to play in the same way I do
[11:29 PM] fancy: but we were just talking now about why the relationship fell apart
[11:29 PM] Nukey: yea
[11:30 PM] Nukey: i just mentioned it
[11:30 PM] Nukey: cus i hoped it would help you get better along with people
[11:30 PM] fancy: I can appreciate that
[11:30 PM] fancy: that's something that like
[11:30 PM] fancy: over the past couple years I've spent time thinking about
[11:30 PM] fancy: during the whole
[11:30 PM] fancy: going from beign a black hole despair
[11:30 PM] fancy: to being a reasonably functional adult
