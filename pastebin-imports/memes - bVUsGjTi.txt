[10:28 PM] fancy: that
[10:28 PM] fancy: was a game
[10:28 PM] fancy: or something
[10:31 PM] A Random Badger: it was a 4v5 game of fuck ups
[10:31 PM] A Random Badger: is what it was
[10:31 PM] fancy: ur draft was really questionable
[10:31 PM] A Random Badger: that was mammoth
[10:31 PM] A Random Badger: i dont draft any more
[10:31 PM] A Random Badger: still tho
[10:31 PM] A Random Badger: it worked
[10:31 PM] A Random Badger: and i think we win if
[10:32 PM] A Random Badger: we have someone other than duckies
[10:32 PM] A Random Badger: and
[10:32 PM] fancy: you have a better chance if you executed that one team fight
[10:32 PM] fancy: but at the same time
[10:32 PM] A Random Badger: mammoth doesnt keep decrepfiying the wrong people
[10:32 PM] fancy: you have a legion adn av oid
[10:32 PM] fancy: and also no way to win duels for legion
[10:32 PM] A Random Badger: yea idk w.e
[10:33 PM] A Random Badger: dont really care for the games anymore
[10:33 PM] fancy: lol okay
[10:34 PM] A Random Badger: i go back to lone wolfing
[10:34 PM] A Random Badger: tis better that way
[10:35 PM] fancy: perhaps
[10:36 PM] A Random Badger: No tis better. I do not enjoy playing with others anymore especially these taw games
[10:36 PM] fancy: ok
[10:55 PM] fancy: I feel like that's something that could be fixed honestly
[10:55 PM] fancy: but
[10:55 PM] fancy: idk
[10:57 PM] A Random Badger: Eh maybe but I mean it's much more personally related than I'm like mad or stressed yanno. It's something I talk to dally about a lot
[11:08 PM] fancy: wat
[11:11 PM] A Random Badger: It's personal... nvm
September 8, 2017
[12:31 AM] fancy: I am confuse
[12:31 AM] fancy: why u drop something liek that and then dodge lol
[12:31 AM] fancy: i don't get it lol
[12:35 AM] fancy: are you just trying to say you don't like people
[12:36 AM] A Random Badger: No
[12:36 AM] A Random Badger: It is slightly complicated and 90% chance you wouldn't understand even if I explained it to you.
[12:37 AM] fancy: I think you don't give people enough credit
[12:39 AM] A Random Badger: No I just come to expect it anymore since most people don't especially when it comes to things they've not really had to experience
[12:40 AM] A Random Badger: And there are plenty, majority even, of people who would look at it as stupid only because they don't really understand.
[12:41 AM] fancy: I can understand that feeling
[12:41 AM] fancy: lots of people have little ability for empathy
[12:41 AM] fancy: or thinking outside themselves
[12:42 AM] A Random Badger: It's w.e just nvm it. If it was a solvable problem I would've solved it by now after 19 years.
[12:42 AM] fancy: That's not necessarily true
[12:43 AM] A Random Badger: Well we'll say more like 12 to 14 years
[12:43 AM] fancy: You can get stuck on things for a long time before you find a solution
[12:43 AM] fancy: and it often ends up being you looked in the wrong place, or something along those lines
[12:45 AM] A Random Badger: Either way it's not something I'm willing to go into. I'll suffer through it like I always have.
[12:46 AM] fancy: I have said the same thing before
[12:46 AM] fancy: All I can say it
[12:46 AM] fancy: a lot of people are disappointing
[12:46 AM] fancy: but a lot of people are capable of a lot more than you might give them credit for
[12:46 AM] fancy: yanno
[12:48 AM] A Random Badger: Which is why I'm very particular about who I'm willing to talk to about the subject tbh
[12:48 AM] fancy: perhaps
[12:50 AM] A Random Badger: Besides based off previous somewhat similar discussions to my problem with you I don't think you'd understand if I just came out with it
[12:51 AM] fancy: I think I disagree and I think it has a lot to do with how you present it
[12:51 AM] fancy: Ex: all our arguments about dota and go
[12:51 AM] fancy: I think you're also guilty of the not understanding and missing the point thing
[12:52 AM] fancy: But I don't think I've presented as not willing to understand where you're coming from
[12:52 AM] fancy: I don't think the reverse is true tho, which is why I dont' engage you in dota discussions any more(edited)
[12:52 AM] fancy: Just a thought
[1:00 AM] A Random Badger: It all comes down to experience. I am of the belief that no one can ever truly understand something the same way as someone else without having dealt with similar types or amounts of experience. For example I have 4 years experience of go. I think you try to understand what I try to explain but I don't think you actually really understand what I'm saying. Same thing for dota where I only have about a years worth of experience compared to yours so it's difficult for me to really understand without more experience. As for my problem, it's an experience I've been having for 19 years and it is not exactly something very many people have to go through so the understanding of it is very limited. Not even family can understand what I mean when I try to tell them no matter how hard they try. They might understand the jist of it but they don't actually understand the situation and everything else that goes with it. You are someone, from what I know about you so far, I don't think would be able to understand since you wouldn't be able to relate to the experience very well.
[1:00 AM] fancy: Maybe not the whole experience, but that doesn't mean there's parts of it
[1:01 AM] fancy: Different people are also better or worse at putting themselves in other people's shoes(edited)
[1:01 AM] fancy: It's a skill
[1:01 AM] fancy: Yeah, it'll never be perfect, but nothing ever is
[1:01 AM] fancy: but I don't think that makes it not worth pursuing
[1:01 AM] fancy: yanno?
[1:02 AM] fancy: Like, no one will ever really understand what my relationship with Ashley is
[1:02 AM] fancy: or the extent to which my relationship with her shaped who I am today
[1:02 AM] fancy: but they can understand enough
[1:02 AM] fancy: to make a difference
[1:02 AM] fancy: enough to make me feel not so alone
[1:03 AM] fancy: that even if they don't understand fully, they can still sympathize and be there
[1:03 AM] fancy: And that's often more than enough
[1:03 AM] fancy: People that are just there
[1:03 AM] fancy: when you  need them
[1:13 AM] A Random Badger: I never really cared for sympathy from others, it never effected me, it never solved or made my problems any easier. My problem is in my 19 years of life I've never had something solid. I've never had people really give a shit. I've never had a single best friend to share my experiences with. Not a damn friend to rely on or trust. I'm a lone wolf because I don't have the bonds that others get to have with people. I'm a broken spirit left to wander with nothing but torment and I'll fucking wear it like a badge until the day I die. Do you understand my words?
[1:15 AM] fancy: Yeah
[1:15 AM] fancy: Have I ever told you about my life?
[1:18 AM] fancy: they're bothing fucking insanely intelligent
[1:18 AM] fancy: and so am I and all my siblings
[1:18 AM] fancy: genetics etc
[1:18 AM] fancy: so I was always the smartest kid in class
[1:18 AM] fancy: and this generally went poorly for me
[1:19 AM] fancy: people didn't like me much because I'm naturally a smart ass and sarcastic and shit etc
[1:19 AM] fancy: but it was made worse because I was also right
[1:19 AM] fancy: a lot of the time
[1:19 AM] fancy: I was an ass about it
[1:19 AM] fancy: but I was an ass that always knew the answer
[1:19 AM] fancy: which is a dangerous combination
[1:19 AM] fancy: because you can't put someone liek that in their place
[1:19 AM] fancy: you can't show them up
[1:19 AM] fancy: so people kept me at a distance
[1:20 AM] fancy: they turned me being smart into a negative
[1:20 AM] fancy: which is something so retarded only middle and high schoolers could do it
[1:20 AM] fancy: "you don't understand us because you're too smart"
[1:20 AM] fancy: like what the actual fuck
[1:20 AM] fancy: is that
[1:20 AM] fancy: but teenage me took it to heart
[1:20 AM] fancy: people rarely if ever invited me to do things
[1:20 AM] fancy: they'd never respond to my texts
[1:21 AM] fancy: or messages at all
[1:21 AM] fancy: until they needed homework help
[1:21 AM] fancy: then I was the most popular kid
[1:21 AM] fancy: because no matter what I was doing I'd always drop everything to help people
[1:21 AM] fancy: because even if I was getting used, negative interactions were better, in my mind, than no interactions
[1:21 AM] fancy: but they left me feeling emtpy and used
[1:22 AM] fancy: and then I started to feel like no one really cared
[1:22 AM] fancy: and they were just putting up with me because they could get something out of me
[1:22 AM] fancy: One of my best memories is
[1:22 AM] fancy: me and this one guy, also Josh, in 11th grade
[1:23 AM] fancy: one night the week before semester finals
[1:23 AM] fancy: we put together this study guide for the chemistry exam
[1:23 AM] fancy: our chem teacher was really bad that year
[1:23 AM] fancy: and a lot of our classmates didn't understand anything at all
[1:23 AM] fancy: but he and I spent
[1:23 AM] fancy: like
[1:23 AM] fancy: we sat down at like 7pm
[1:24 AM] fancy: and finished at 1:30 am
[1:24 AM] fancy: putting together a study guide for everything that was going to be on the exam
[1:24 AM] fancy: with examples and illustrations
[1:24 AM] fancy: This was at a time where I couldn't be assed to do my own school work ever
[1:24 AM] fancy: because I fucking hated school
[1:24 AM] fancy: and I still do
[1:25 AM] fancy: I hate classes
[1:25 AM] fancy: and back then I liked myself even less than I do now, so I could hardly be persuaded to do anything for myself
[1:25 AM] fancy: I didn't sleep right, I didn't eat right, I didn't go to class, I went and slept through them
[1:25 AM] fancy: I never did homework
[1:25 AM] fancy: by my senior year I had dropped from all a's all year
[1:25 AM] fancy: which I'd had since fucking
[1:26 AM] fancy: kindergarten
[1:26 AM] fancy: to my senior year, where I failed 4/6 classes
[1:26 AM] fancy: idk how I graduated
[1:26 AM] fancy: I didn't even write my junior thesis
[1:26 AM] fancy: I never wrote a word of one
[1:26 AM] fancy: but that's another story
[1:26 AM] fancy: anyway
[1:26 AM] fancy: so I couldn't be arsed to help myself at all
[1:26 AM] fancy: but the only thing I ever would do
[1:27 AM] fancy: is burn myself out to help these other people who clearly didn't give a damn about me
[1:27 AM] fancy: but I gave them everything I had anywya
[1:27 AM] fancy: all my time and attention
[1:27 AM] fancy: I knew after I finished that study guide I'd never look at it again
[1:27 AM] fancy: I didn't study, I didn't give a shit
[1:27 AM] fancy: but that's the kind of thing I would do
[1:27 AM] fancy: I'd give all of myself there was to give
[1:27 AM] fancy: to people who didn't appreciate it
[1:27 AM] fancy: and definitely didn't deserve it
[1:28 AM] fancy: because after it was all said and done, they didnt' like me
[1:28 AM] fancy: they liked what I'd do for them
[1:28 AM] fancy: and I let it happen
[1:28 AM] fancy: because I didn't want to be alone
[1:28 AM] fancy: because even though I'm shy I hate being alone
[1:28 AM] fancy: and then somehow
[1:28 AM] fancy: through some miracle I graduated
[1:28 AM] fancy: evne though I failed everything my senior year
[1:29 AM] fancy: I almost didn't even apply to college
[1:29 AM] fancy: I didn't write a single application until literally the day they were due
[1:29 AM] fancy: I didn't get into 5 out of the 6 schools I applied to
[1:29 AM] fancy: which kinda hurt at the time
[1:29 AM] fancy: but looking back , thank god I didn't
[1:29 AM] fancy: but like
[1:29 AM] fancy: I had the scores
[1:30 AM] fancy: I got like a 2300 on my SAT
[1:30 AM] fancy: i had a 35 on my ACT
[1:30 AM] fancy: I played varsity baseball for 6 years
[1:30 AM] fancy: i was in boy scouts
[1:30 AM] fancy: I programmed as a hobby(edited)
[1:31 AM] fancy: when I was in fifth grade, I taught myself XML, and basically rebuilt HTML from scratch
[1:31 AM] fancy: just because I could
[1:31 AM] fancy: so like
[1:31 AM] fancy: I had all this potential
[1:31 AM] fancy: and yet
[1:31 AM] fancy: here I am
[1:31 AM] fancy: with like a 1.5 gpa
[1:31 AM] fancy: my senior year
[1:31 AM] fancy: I had parents with money
[1:31 AM] fancy: I could have gone anywhere in the world I wanted
[1:31 AM] fancy: to any school
[1:31 AM] fancy: I had lots of teachers willing to vouch for me
[1:31 AM] fancy: yet I felt alone
[1:32 AM] fancy: and a lot of that was because I never liked who I was
[1:32 AM] fancy: and so i let myself
[1:32 AM] fancy: spiral down
[1:32 AM] fancy: because I never felt like people understood me
[1:32 AM] fancy: or really cared about me
[1:32 AM] fancy: they just saw what i could be
[1:32 AM] fancy: and never asked what I wanted to be
[1:33 AM] fancy: "you can do great things, you could do anything you set your mind to"
[1:33 AM] fancy: because all they saw was my more or less perfect outside life
[1:33 AM] fancy: they didn't see that I didn't feel like anyone liked me for who I was
[1:33 AM] fancy: that I felt alone
[1:33 AM] fancy: that I felt distanced from everyone
[1:33 AM] fancy: so I eventually gave in
[1:34 AM] fancy: I went to two semesters of college
[1:34 AM] fancy: because tha'ts what I was supposed to do
[1:34 AM] fancy: you graduate and you go to more school
[1:34 AM] fancy: turns out
[1:34 AM] fancy: I still hated school
[1:34 AM] fancy: That summer after I graduated
[1:34 AM] fancy: was when I met ashley
[1:34 AM] fancy: through a mutual friend I'd known from tf2 for a while
[1:35 AM] fancy: and within two weeks, you would have sworn we'd been best friends for years
[1:35 AM] fancy: we got along so well
[1:35 AM] fancy: and I felt like I'd finally met someone that liked me for me
[1:35 AM] fancy: not because I did their homework
[1:35 AM] fancy: even tho I helped her with hers too
[1:35 AM] fancy: but I felt like she liked me as a person
[1:35 AM] fancy: she made me feel good about who I was
[1:35 AM] fancy: like I didn't need to pretend
[1:36 AM] fancy: or constantly look out for how other people feel
[1:36 AM] fancy: or act certain ways
[1:36 AM] fancy: or do certain things
[1:36 AM] fancy: lest they just realize how awful I actually am
[1:36 AM] fancy: and leave
[1:36 AM] fancy: because that's always been my fear
[1:36 AM] fancy: eventually people will on eday realize(edited)
[1:36 AM] fancy: how shitty I am
[1:36 AM] fancy: and be like
[1:36 AM] fancy: fuck this noise I'm out
[1:36 AM] fancy: and I'll be alone again
[1:36 AM] fancy: that's my fear
[1:36 AM] fancy: that's what I'm afraid will happen
[1:36 AM] fancy: every day of my life
[1:36 AM] fancy: but she made me feel safe
[1:37 AM] fancy: she made me feel loved
[1:37 AM] fancy: and accepted
[1:37 AM] fancy: idk when it happened but we both ended up falling for each other
[1:37 AM] fancy: there was a lot of passion and a lot of chemistry
[1:37 AM] fancy: but she lived in canada
[1:37 AM] fancy: so at the back of my mind I was like wtf how is this going to work
[1:37 AM] fancy: but at the same time I didn't care
[1:38 AM] fancy: she was dating this guy at the time
[1:38 AM] fancy: James
[1:38 AM] fancy: and I'm sure he was a decent guy
[1:38 AM] fancy: and maybe they ultimately would have worked out
[1:38 AM] fancy: but she and I got way too close
[1:38 AM] fancy: like way closer than friends should ever be
[1:38 AM] fancy: when one of them is supposedly dating another guy
[1:38 AM] fancy: eventually it kinda came to a head
[1:38 AM] fancy: she felt guilty
[1:39 AM] fancy: because even though we weren't official and we technically didn't do anything
[1:39 AM] fancy: it wasn't right
[1:39 AM] fancy: yanno
[1:39 AM] fancy: like it wasn't fair to James
[1:39 AM] fancy: and so eventually she decided she had to tell him
[1:39 AM] fancy: what was going on
[1:39 AM] fancy: and be honest
[1:39 AM] fancy: and so she did
[1:39 AM] fancy: and his response
[1:39 AM] fancy: was anger at first
[1:39 AM] fancy: but then he calmed down
[1:39 AM] fancy: and was like
[1:39 AM] fancy: "i want to make this work, and I want to give you another chance"
[1:39 AM] fancy: "but you can't ever talk to fancy again"
[1:40 AM] fancy: and this whole time she'd made me believe there's no doubt in her mind who she likes better
[1:40 AM] fancy: whenever she'd have relationships problems
[1:40 AM] fancy: or arguments
[1:40 AM] fancy: with him
[1:40 AM] fancy: I was the person she came to
[1:40 AM] fancy: whenever she was feeling way too stressed by school
[1:40 AM] fancy: she came to me first
[1:40 AM] fancy: she told me she liked me better
[1:40 AM] fancy: and that she thought she'd be happier with me than with him
[1:41 AM] fancy: she told me she loved me
[1:41 AM] fancy: but when he gave her this ultimatum
[1:41 AM] fancy: she took two weeks to finally tell him her decision
[1:41 AM] fancy: the whole time she reassured me that she'd pick me
[1:41 AM] fancy: but she also said she didn't want to hurt his feelings
[1:41 AM] fancy: so she just didn't answer
[1:41 AM] fancy: and put it off
[1:41 AM] fancy: so I tried to give her space
[1:41 AM] fancy: because I thought it was the right thing to do
[1:42 AM] fancy: She started hanging out with a group of friends at her uni
[1:42 AM] fancy: and when all this drama happened
[1:42 AM] fancy: the frequency increased
[1:42 AM] fancy: so she could get away from all the drama for a while
[1:42 AM] fancy: the was this one guy
[1:42 AM] fancy: Radu
[1:55 AM] fancy: between me
[1:55 AM] fancy: and another guy
[1:55 AM] fancy: she told me the same stuff she'd said before
[1:55 AM] fancy: that she loved me
[1:55 AM] fancy: that she was going ot choose me
[1:55 AM] fancy: but yet she dragged it out
[1:56 AM] fancy: she procrastinated her decision
[1:56 AM] fancy: two weeks before my trip
[1:56 AM] fancy: she told me
[1:56 AM] fancy: that she'd made her decision
[1:56 AM] fancy: she told me that she was staying with radu
[1:56 AM] fancy: and that I shouldn't come visit
[1:56 AM] fancy: I don't know what I expected
[1:56 AM] fancy: but I was fucking destroyed
[1:57 AM] fancy: I don't even rememeber the rest of that day
[1:57 AM] fancy: I was at work when she told me
[1:57 AM] fancy: I'm pretty sure I went out to my car to cry
[1:57 AM] fancy: she told me that we couldn't talk any more
[1:57 AM] fancy: that it was "for the best"
[1:57 AM] fancy: and so
[1:57 AM] fancy: once again
[1:57 AM] fancy: my best friend
[1:57 AM] fancy: gone
[1:58 AM] fancy: some time you should ask pizza about how I was
[1:58 AM] fancy: during this time
[1:58 AM] fancy: because I know I won't be able to do it justice
[1:58 AM] fancy: because I have always been bad
[1:58 AM] fancy: at assessing myself
[1:58 AM] fancy: I know I was a wreck though
[1:59 AM] fancy: For a long time, that was the meme
[1:59 AM] fancy: fancy was the emotional, depressed, miserable kid
[1:59 AM] fancy: who saw no point to life
[1:59 AM] fancy: who wanted to burn out and die at 30
[1:59 AM] fancy: who thought that everyone was just in it to get something from him
[1:59 AM] fancy: and use him up
[1:59 AM] fancy: until he was a broken husk
[1:59 AM] fancy: because that's all he'd ever known
[2:00 AM] fancy: I look back on it now
[2:00 AM] fancy: Ash and I are kinda friends again
[2:00 AM] fancy: sorta
[2:00 AM] fancy: we reconnected
[2:01 AM] fancy: there was still a bit of spark left but it's mostly dead now
[2:01 AM] fancy: she ended up breaking up with radu after 2 years or something because he was just
[2:01 AM] fancy: not mature enough
[2:01 AM] fancy: not ready for a real relationship I think
[2:01 AM] fancy: I think it's been good for her
[2:01 AM] fancy: from the time I met her
[2:01 AM] fancy: until she broke up with radu
[2:01 AM] fancy: she was single for a total of one week
[2:02 AM] fancy: she and I talk occassionally now
[2:02 AM] fancy: But looking back
[2:02 AM] fancy: She played a huge role in who I am today
[2:02 AM] fancy: because even though she hurt me
[2:02 AM] fancy: because of that
[2:03 AM] fancy: I had the opportunity, once I decided to take it
[2:03 AM] fancy: to learn
[2:03 AM] fancy: to grow
[2:03 AM] fancy: So yeah, it sucked
[2:03 AM] fancy: and I'd never go through it again
[2:03 AM] fancy: But I think I'm a better person for it all
[2:03 AM] fancy: I held on to my anger at her
[2:03 AM] fancy: for a long time
[2:03 AM] fancy: because I wanted to be angry
[2:03 AM] fancy: I felt cheated
[2:03 AM] fancy: by the world
[2:03 AM] fancy: and in a way I was
[2:03 AM] fancy: if I'd only been 3 years older or lived in canada or any number of things
[2:03 AM] fancy: maybe I would have gotten a real chance with her
[2:04 AM] fancy: I still have never loved another person like I loved her
[2:04 AM] fancy: maybe one day I will
[2:04 AM] fancy: I don't know yet
[2:04 AM] fancy: but I know that
[2:04 AM] fancy: she and I are friends again now
[2:04 AM] fancy: even though not great friends
[2:04 AM] fancy: but I learned I didn't need to hold on to my anger
[2:04 AM] fancy: and even though what she did
[2:04 AM] fancy: was really fucking shitty
[2:04 AM] fancy: in a lot of ways
[2:04 AM] fancy: I could either hold on to that
[2:04 AM] fancy: or just let it go
[2:05 AM] fancy: and when I learned to let it go
[2:05 AM] fancy: I started to get a lot happier
[2:05 AM] fancy: and a lot more okay with life
[2:05 AM] fancy: when I learned that
[2:05 AM] fancy: you don't have to focus on all the bad shit
[2:05 AM] fancy: even though there's a lot of bad shit
[2:05 AM] fancy: because doing that doesn't help anything
[2:05 AM] fancy: and it seemed impossible
[2:05 AM] fancy: for a long time
[2:05 AM] fancy: to just
[2:05 AM] fancy: "do" that
[2:06 AM] fancy: just "don't focus on the bad stuff"
[2:06 AM] fancy: and I'd always tell people
[2:06 AM] fancy: that
[2:06 AM] fancy: "it doesn't work like that"
[2:06 AM] fancy: "I can't just feel better"
[2:06 AM] fancy: and that's true
[2:06 AM] fancy: it doesn't work like that
[2:06 AM] fancy: and it's a shame that it doesn't
[2:06 AM] fancy: I had to hit rock bottom
[2:06 AM] fancy: I had to become so miserable
[2:06 AM] fancy: and so fucking hopeless
[2:07 AM] fancy: for so long
[2:07 AM] fancy: before I realized
[2:07 AM] fancy: finally
[2:07 AM] fancy: that I didn't want to feel bad any more
[2:07 AM] fancy: and it doesn't happen overnight
[2:07 AM] fancy: and it's slow
[2:07 AM] fancy: and painful
[2:07 AM] fancy: but I realize now
[2:07 AM] fancy: a lot of it was me deciding
[2:07 AM] fancy: I was miserable
[2:07 AM] fancy: and that, that was just how it was
[2:07 AM] fancy: and nothing ever changed
[2:07 AM] fancy: and people don't change
[2:08 AM] fancy: and I kinda just resigned myself to my misery
[2:08 AM] fancy: I thought I'd never meet people who actually cared
[2:08 AM] fancy: I thought that everyone was the same
[2:08 AM] fancy: I'm slowly being proven wrong I think
[2:08 AM] fancy: but I'm at least giving people a chance again
[2:09 AM] fancy: I'm lucky
[2:09 AM] fancy: in some ways
[2:09 AM] fancy: I met subhanshu probably somewhere in late 2011 or 2012
[2:09 AM] fancy: 2011 I think
[2:10 AM] fancy: just on a random tf2 server
[2:10 AM] fancy: he added me cus I was a good medic or some shit
[2:10 AM] fancy: and some how
[2:10 AM] fancy: over the years
[2:10 AM] fancy: he's turned into the best friend I ever had
[2:10 AM] fancy: even though
[2:10 AM] fancy: I treated him like shit
[2:11 AM] fancy: he invited me to his friend's tf2 team
[2:11 AM] fancy: way back
[2:11 AM] fancy: shortly after he added me
[2:11 AM] fancy: that's how I got into competitve tf2
[2:11 AM] fancy: that's where I first met nukey
[2:11 AM] fancy: who's the one that introduced me to ashley and her brother
[2:11 AM] fancy: and nukey got me into dota
[2:11 AM] fancy: and subhanshu one day realized hey I play dota and he plays dota
[2:12 AM] fancy: and we should play some time
[2:12 AM] fancy: he played with me and old stack
[2:12 AM] fancy: which was ashley and her brother nathan
[2:12 AM] fancy: and their friend jason
[2:12 AM] fancy: and nukey
[2:12 AM] fancy: a couple times
[2:12 AM] fancy: which is when ashley told me that
[2:12 AM] fancy: she didn't like him very much
[2:12 AM] fancy: and because I was
[2:12 AM] fancy: starry eyed and in love
[2:12 AM] fancy: was inspired to just
[2:13 AM] fancy: remove and block him
[2:13 AM] fancy: without saying anything
[2:13 AM] fancy: idr how long it was
[2:13 AM] fancy: but one day he realized I'd blocked him
[2:13 AM] fancy: and he was naturally confused
[2:13 AM] fancy: cus we had played dota together not infrequently
[2:13 AM] fancy: etc etc
[2:13 AM] fancy: so by chance he just
[2:13 AM] fancy: adds a random person off my friends list
[2:13 AM] fancy: liek
[2:13 AM] fancy: a  year later
[2:14 AM] fancy: after I'd removed him
[2:14 AM] fancy: or some sht
[2:14 AM] fancy: and it happened to be ashley
[2:14 AM] fancy: life's funny like that sometimes
[2:14 AM] fancy: and that's how he got back in to my life
[2:14 AM] fancy: and since then he's honestly been one of the best things that's ever happened to me
[2:14 AM] fancy: this dumbass, slightly too arrogant kid
[2:14 AM] fancy: turned into my best friend when I never expected it
[2:15 AM] fancy: and even though I thought ashley was the one
[2:15 AM] fancy: who cared about me
[2:15 AM] fancy: and was always going to have my back
[2:15 AM] fancy: here comes this kid
[2:15 AM] fancy: and he's been here with me
[2:15 AM] fancy: through it all now
[2:15 AM] fancy: he's honestly basically the only reason I'm not dead
[2:16 AM] fancy: his friendship saved my life, and i never would have expected it
[2:16 AM] fancy: so even though he's a dumbass sometimes and has lots of flaws, as anyone does, I will never stop singing his praises
[2:16 AM] fancy: he's the first real friend I ever had
[2:17 AM] fancy: and I didn't really meet him until I was almost 20
[2:17 AM] A Random Badger: Okay I got the jist of it I really need sleep. At least you got to have a few friends though. Maybe another time I'll consider going into my miserable shit fest of a life. Tomorrow's my day off but I'll probably just be hanging out by myself like I planned.
[2:18 AM] fancy: perhaps
[2:18 AM] fancy: go sleep dumdum lol
[2:18 AM] fancy: I had friends that stabbed me in the back, maybe you had no friends at all
[2:18 AM] fancy: everyone has their own shit
[2:18 AM] fancy: life sucks and then you die
[2:18 AM] fancy: it's all about finding the people that make it suck less
[2:19 AM] fancy: and sometimes that means learnign that you yourself are a dumbass, and then learning that that's okay
[2:19 AM] fancy: we're all just making it up as we go
[2:19 AM] A Random Badger: If you're lucky enough to find them. Life's just a game of luck after all.
[2:19 AM] fancy: hardest thign I ever learned was to forgive myself
[2:19 AM] fancy: part of it's luck
[2:19 AM] fancy: part of it's up to you
[2:20 AM] fancy: that's what I've learned
[2:20 AM] A Random Badger: Idk about that. I don't think it matters what you do. You just draw a straw and get in line.
[2:20 AM] fancy: You have options
[2:20 AM] A Random Badger: As far as I'm concerned
[2:21 AM] fancy: you get dealt cards, but you still get to play them
[2:21 AM] fancy: I could have chosen to shut everyone off completely and then I'd be dead right now
[2:21 AM] A Random Badger: I don't see it that way. But that's another conversation. I have to sleep.
[2:21 AM] fancy: I could have chosen to be hard working and fly through school
[2:21 AM] fancy: have two degress and be making 200k rn
[2:21 AM] fancy: lots of things can happen(edited)
[2:22 AM] fancy: but yes
[2:22 AM] fancy: sleep
[2:23 AM] fancy: all I can leave you with, is that, as someone who's been there, who's said the same thing: that life just is what it is and there's nothign you can do about it
[2:23 AM] fancy: I, at least, was wrong.
[2:23 AM] fancy: It's all a matter of perspective.
