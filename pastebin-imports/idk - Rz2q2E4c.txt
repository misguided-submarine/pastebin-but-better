MMR IS JUST A NUMBER

[4:56 PM] 공상: post the original too
[4:56 PM] 공상: moron
[4:56 PM] A Random Badger: see if it were me and i cared, my opinion would be, as a low end 5k player that if im in a game where there are players 1 or 2k above me who play my role, i'd still much rather play my prefered role even if i lose the lane that way i actually directly see the mistakes im making and improve from them. i feel like at a certain point mmr really just isnt a very good gauge for how much you improve if you're just letting people who are better than you carry you, because you're not seeing your mistakes by letting chances like playing against someone so significantly better than you slip by. thats my opinion anyways. but if you only care about mmr then sure go ahead and let the best player carry you but at that point i dont think your mmr is accurately gauging your improvement, or in the very least, improvement at your prefered role. \
[4:56 PM] pizza: original?
[4:56 PM] A Random Badger: i saw the original one
[4:57 PM] A Random Badger: there was a video where he said your ruining a game by taking a higher mmr peson's prefered role and i think there was backlash about it which is why he made this one
[4:57 PM] pizza: oh yeah i saw the reddit drama abotu that
[4:57 PM] A Random Badger: yeaaa
[4:57 PM] A Random Badger: i mean like i kinda agree with it
[4:58 PM] A Random Badger: but my aguement is what i already said ^
[4:58 PM] A Random Badger: i disagree with his point in this topic that mmr is a good gauge for your improvement rate
[4:59 PM] pizza: i mean, i think mmr is a good gauge for how good you are at winning pubs
[4:59 PM] pizza: you just have to extrapolate from there
[4:59 PM] A Random Badger: i feel like you would get to a point where yea you're 7k and you get to play your prefered role now but now you're only like playing at a 6k skill level
[5:00 PM] A Random Badger: i mean i think mmr is a good gauge for improvement
[5:00 PM] A Random Badger: but not in this scenario he's talking about
[5:00 PM] A Random Badger: where you let your preferred role go to someone better than you
[5:01 PM] pizza: but he's not saying that the situation even comes up often
[5:01 PM] pizza: he's saying that, in those situations
[5:01 PM] pizza: you should let the person who's 1k above you take the role he wants
[5:01 PM] pizza: because ultimately, when you queue for a ranked game, you're queueing to win
[5:01 PM] pizza: if you're queueing to win but with a higher bias on learning something, you shouldn't be doing ranked
[5:01 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[5:02 PM] A Random Badger: i disagree with that
[5:02 PM] A Random Badger: i think the best opportunity for improvement
[5:02 PM] A Random Badger: comes when you get to play against people significantly better than you with your preffered role
[5:02 PM] A Random Badger: otherwise you're not gaining anything as far as your preferred role is concerned
[5:02 PM] A Random Badger: maybe you learn things in that secondary role you play
[5:02 PM] A Random Badger: but not always necessarily your preferred one
[5:03 PM] pizza: playing against people significantly better than you isnt' a good way to learn. You'll lose for factors that seem otu of your control, factors that you might not even yet understand
[5:03 PM] pizza: but either way
[5:03 PM] pizza: it's not like you're the one 5k player in a game of 7k's
[5:03 PM] pizza: the scenario is that the average mmr is like 5.5k or something, you're 5k and the highest player on your team happens to be 7k or something
[5:03 PM] pizza: or 6k
[5:03 PM] pizza: and the other team has a 6k player too
[5:03 PM] pizza: you're not like, way below average skill in the game
[5:05 PM] A Random Badger: no but probability is that the average mmr will still be higher than your own or around your own in which case its still pretty optimal to attempt to play your preferred role in order to learn
[5:05 PM] A Random Badger: plus
[5:05 PM] A Random Badger: if a 7k is playing in a 6k average mmr game
[5:05 PM] A Random Badger: he should have like no problem being able to play a secondary role tb
[5:05 PM] A Random Badger: tbh
[5:06 PM] A Random Badger: after all isnt it always said that to gain mmr you should know and understand all the roles, not just one?
[5:06 PM] 공상: If you're playing ranked for any other reason than to win points you're doing it wrong is blitz's point
[5:06 PM] pizza: and i agree with that
[5:06 PM] pizza: if you're playing ranked, you should be playing it to win
[5:06 PM] 공상: if you take the preferred role and pick order from someone with 2k more MMR, you're actively deciding that winning isn't your priority
[5:07 PM] pizza: yes
[5:07 PM] pizza: also badger we could have a lengthy discussion about how it's not really beneficial to play against people who are an average of 1-2k better than you
[5:07 PM] pizza: because you'll just lose
[5:07 PM] pizza: and hardly learn anything from it
[5:07 PM] 공상: on top of that fighting someone in the midlane that's 9k and you're 5k you learn very little
[5:08 PM] A Random Badger: i still dont agree with that, because you playing your best role in a higher skill game than your own mmr is definitely playing to win lol especially when you consider, what i just said, that a higher mmr person should be able to play, imo, just about every other role or at least a secondary role above or around the mmr average anyways
[5:08 PM] pizza: No.
[5:08 PM] 공상: false
[5:08 PM] pizza: If your offlane is 5k tier
[5:08 PM] 공상: rtz can't support at a 10k level
[5:08 PM] pizza: and his offlan eplay is 7k
[5:08 PM] pizza: but you are made to support at a 4k level
[5:08 PM] pizza: so that he can 7k offlane
[5:08 PM] pizza: or mid or whatever
[5:08 PM] pizza: that's way better
[5:09 PM] pizza: that player is your team's strongest asset
[5:09 PM] 공상: it's a team game, not an everyone do what they're best at game
[5:10 PM] 공상: especially in terms of midlane which is probably the single most important lane
[5:10 PM] 공상: because you're the highest level and the most farmed hero after the laning stage
[5:11 PM] pizza: we should address this one point at a time badger
[5:11 PM] A Random Badger: then what point are we on
[5:11 PM] pizza: first off, do you agree that "if you queue for a ranked game and your primary objective isn't to win, you're doing it wrong"
[5:11 PM] A Random Badger: yes
[5:13 PM] 공상: do you agree that, as a team, you should utilize your assets in the most overall expedient way
[5:13 PM] 공상: in order to win
[5:18 PM] A Random Badger: so my struggle is with this concept and maybe it's wrong for dota, but i think soloq is much different compared to partyq and pubs, where partyq is more reliant on team coordination and utilizing assets accordingly is more improtant than playing greedy, where in soloq i think you should be playing for yourself and your own improvement especially in cases where your team isnt coordinating at all anyways. but idk, maybe i am still out of the loop of dota and maybe im still in the loop of LoL and 1v1 games like sc2 and go
[5:21 PM] 공상: that's a mentality that only really applies in like sub4k games I think
[5:21 PM] 공상: where people are barely playing dota
[5:22 PM] 공상: partyq is way more casual in high MMR
[5:23 PM] 공상: playing for yourself stops being playing to win once you get into games where you aren't the best player
[5:23 PM] 공상: it really should just be called playing around your best player
[5:24 PM] 공상: playing to improve is also not the same as playing to win
[5:24 PM] 공상: that's why I don't play ranked
[5:24 PM] 공상: cus I don't care about the points
[5:24 PM] 공상: I just want to be good
5:26 PM] A Random Badger: maybe, because my opinion is and probably always will be that self improvement is always more improtant than winning because through self-improvement you will start to increase your win rate. i am of the mentality that you have to lose some to gain more. and my problem with his arguement is it doesnt sound liek youre actively risking anything enough for self improvement and getting better at the game  and instead it becomes just a game of who has more points which i think is a bad
[5:26 PM] 공상: what
[5:26 PM] 공상: what do you mean it becomes a game of who has more points
[5:27 PM] A Random Badger: like rtz having more mmr points than several other competitive players in his role who are significantly better than him
[5:27 PM] A Random Badger: its a game of points over a game of skill
[5:27 PM] 공상: they're not
[5:28 PM] 공상: in terms of pubs they are not better than he is
[5:28 PM] 공상: or they'd also be 10k
[5:29 PM] 공상: rtz's problem is more likely that he doesn't fit his team, their coordination isn't as good, their strats aren't as good etc etc
[5:29 PM] 공상: a team of 6ks can beat a team of 8ks easy
[5:30 PM] 공상: 5 random 6ks won't beat 5 random 8ks
[5:30 PM] 공상: if your goal is improvement, playing pubs is a really bad way to do it
[5:30 PM] 공상: at least in these scenarios
[5:31 PM] 공상: where you have a player that's 2k MMR higher
[5:31 PM] 공상: when everyone's 5k or everyone's 6k, sure play what you want
[5:31 PM] 공상: but if you are 5k and you have an 8k or a 9k, you defer to them
[5:34 PM] A Random Badger: no but 5 specifically paired 7ks who take risks to understand their roles and how to play around the game in soloq  vs 5 specifically paired 9ks who only know how to win soloq based off of limited hero pools they're really good at will get squashed by the 7k team who knows how to macro-game effectively (this is a response to the 6ks vs 8ks point btw not a general response) but i guess this is going outside the discussion of soloq when comparing it to competitive play which is much different
[5:35 PM] A Random Badger: i guess my point and opinion would be that playing to improve is much better in soloq when you want to be a good player in competitive, and playing to win is much better when all you care about is being really good in soloq and not competitive.
[5:36 PM] A Random Badger: and it depends on the person i guess
[5:36 PM] 공상: if you want to be a good competitive player, you scrim
[5:36 PM] 공상: with a consistent team
[5:37 PM] A Random Badger: to learn the macro-based elements of the game, but not when it comes to actual individual practice
[5:37 PM] 공상: soloq isn't a different game you know that right
[5:37 PM] A Random Badger: i think you still need to play solo to practice
[5:38 PM] A Random Badger: soloq is not different game but it is different in play compared to competitive
[5:40 PM] 공상: I disagree that 7ks that aren't familiar with each other would beat 9ks that aren't familiar with each other
[5:40 PM] 공상: also you don't get to 9k by only playing 3 heroes
[5:41 PM] 공상: you don't get 7ks that know dota better than 9ks
[5:41 PM] 공상: otherwise theyd be 9k
[5:43 PM] 공상: and I think the resolution of this discussion is just that you don't actually think the goal of ranked matchmaking is to win points
[5:47 PM] 공상: consider the skill gap between me and redman
[5:47 PM] A Random Badger: no and i dont think any of us will really know until all of us get to like 7k at least lol cause this is all really just speculation, and we'd have to ask the 9ks ourselves
[5:47 PM] A Random Badger: but you said it yourself that low mmr and high mmr is very different
[5:48 PM] A Random Badger: so the skill gap between you and redman doesnt accurately compare the skill gap of a 7k and 9k
[5:48 PM] 공상: and how many things that are second nature to me and Redman only considers in retrospect of at all
[5:48 PM] 공상: it's the same type of gap in 7 and 9k
[5:48 PM] 공상: that's what blitz is saying
[5:49 PM] 공상: I don't have to get there to know what people that are there say about it
[5:50 PM] 공상: I can also watch a stream of a 5k and a stream of an 8k and tell the difference
[5:50 PM] A Random Badger: what mmr is blitz
[5:50 PM] 공상: blitz has made it to 8k, he also is surrounded by a community of pros
[5:50 PM] 공상: because he coaches teams
[5:50 PM] 공상: and casts
[5:51 PM] 공상: even he, who's probably one of the best storms in the world, gives up mid to ccnc, sumail, etc
[5:51 PM] 공상: even tho the meme is that blitz is 9k storm, 5k everything else
[5:51 PM] 공상: and ccnc in turn concedes mid to 747, and sumail, and abed
[5:53 PM] A Random Badger: i mean i dont know the guy but why isnt he 8k anymore if he's going by his own advice and only playing to win lol
[5:53 PM] 공상: cus he's not good enough?
[5:54 PM] 공상: he's probably 7k or something idr
[5:54 PM] 공상: he had to try really hard to get to 8k, and then he took time off playing to cast and coach
[5:54 PM] 공상: it takes a toll
[5:54 PM] 공상: he still plays to win lol
[5:55 PM] 공상: idk what not being 8k any more has to do with playing to win
[5:55 PM] A Random Badger: doesnt that say by itself that he should try to focus on self-improvement then if he wanted to get to 8k? because at what point does it become that some 8ks are 8k because they actively learned and studied the game to improve and some 8ks are 8k just because they have a nack for the game
5:56 PM] 공상: at no point has anyone said you shouldn't try to improve
[5:56 PM] 공상: also what difference does it make how you're 8k
[5:57 PM] 공상: why have you suddenly turned this into a character discussion of blitz
[5:57 PM] 공상: don't dodge the topic lol
[5:57 PM] 공상: the original point is, you play ranked to win points
[5:58 PM] 공상: and sometimes the best way to win that set of 25 points is to concede your preferred role
[5:58 PM] 공상: if you ignore that, and don't defer to the player that's 2k MMR above you, you're no longer playing to win
[5:58 PM] 공상: that is blitz's point
[5:58 PM] 공상: not on how to improve
[5:58 PM] 공상: or how to gain MMR
[5:58 PM] 공상: or how to play mid
[5:59 PM] 공상: because for every game you have a 2k MMR player higher than you, you have 3 or 4 or 5 with everyone the same level as you
[5:59 PM] A Random Badger: so where do you get to put your priority on improvement then?
[5:59 PM] A Random Badger: normals?
[5:59 PM] 공상: not in ranked
[5:59 PM] 공상: like he said
[6:00 PM] 공상: well
[6:00 PM] 공상: not in ranked against people 2k MMR higher than you
[6:00 PM] 공상: I guarantee if I played someone mid that was 6k+ I would learn very very little
[6:00 PM] 공상: I would lose and maybe I'd kinda have an idea
[6:00 PM] 공상: but it wouldn't be close
[6:00 PM] 공상: when I play pizza mid it's close, and I can learn
[6:01 PM] 공상: when I play other people in taw mid, they don't learn anything
[6:01 PM] 공상: playing dota is a pretty inefficient way to learn dota
[6:01 PM] A Random Badger: well thats because you're supposed to put actual effort into analyzing the things that are happening ]
[6:02 PM] 공상: which is
[6:02 PM] 공상: not playing dota
[6:02 PM] 공상: lol
[6:02 PM] 공상: improving is a secondary priority in ranked to winning points
[6:02 PM] 공상: because ranked = unranked
[6:02 PM] 공상: except you can see points
[6:02 PM] 공상: literally no reason to play ranked other than that
[6:02 PM] 공상: if it was like csgo, different discussion
[6:03 PM] A Random Badger: but if you play vs people 2k mmr higher than you, you can go back and anaylze what happened and i think that is still much more valuable than just looking at the mistakes your making vs someone 500 mmr higher than you
[6:03 PM] 공상: no it really isn't
[6:03 PM] 공상: you probably will lose purely on mechanics
[6:03 PM] 공상: or things you don't understand why
[6:03 PM] 공상: without them explaining it
6:04 PM] 공상: but regardless
[6:04 PM] 공상: it's still not playing to win
[6:04 PM] 공상: so don't do it
[6:04 PM] 공상: that's the whole point
6:08 PM] A Random Badger: maybe im just thinking about this backwards then
[6:08 PM] 공상: if I played you in go, how much would I learn
[6:08 PM] 공상: without you specifically trying to teach me(edited)
[6:09 PM] A Random Badger: i'll say playing to win should be top priority but improvement should matter more than the actual win
[6:09 PM] 공상: uh
[6:09 PM] 공상: badger
[6:09 PM] 공상: that
[6:09 PM] 공상: doesn't work
[6:09 PM] Nukey: being cute is definetely subjective
[6:09 PM] 공상: that's a is most important but b is more important than a
[6:09 PM] 공상: that doesn't make sense
[6:10 PM] A Random Badger: no i mean in terms of how you take the result, like i think if you lose but you played your best to win, as long as your still learned something and improved then good, but if you just play to win but then lose and comletely ignore the potential improvement then you did it wrong
[6:11 PM] A Random Badger: i worded it wrong i think
[6:11 PM] 공상: I mean
[6:11 PM] 공상: sure
[6:11 PM] 공상: even if you learn nothing it's whatever
[6:11 PM] 공상: sometimes there's nothing to learn
[6:11 PM] 공상: sometimes you get a tide safelane support that has no clue what tide is
[6:11 PM] 공상: and you just lose
6:12 PM] 공상: not much to be learned there other than tide is a bad safelane support when he has never played tide before
[6:12 PM] A Random Badger: ive seen those when i started playing.....
[6:12 PM] 공상: I had one like three days ago
[6:12 PM] A Random Badger: also to respond to the go question
[6:12 PM] 공상: was rough
[6:12 PM] 공상: first item wand
[6:12 PM] 공상: sobs
6:15 PM] pizza: also
[6:15 PM] pizza: badger
[6:15 PM] A Random Badger: i dont think you learn anything unless you know what specific moves mean. this goes back to the other discussion and how i think you can analyze a dota game and fairly easily be able to read the intention of something at a basic level, even without much prior knowledge except the goal of the game. but in go you actually have to like study the basics and what moves mean even if you understand the goal of the game because of how abstract the game is i guess which is why i was stating the opinion that i think go is much more difficult to get into compared to dota
[6:15 PM] pizza: i agree with literally everything josh said
[6:16 PM] pizza: if you're 2k
[6:16 PM] pizza: and you got stomped by a 4k
[6:16 PM] pizza: chances are that even if you evaluate the game afterwads
[6:16 PM] pizza: *afterwards
[6:16 PM] pizza: you probably won't have a clue of what really happened
[6:16 PM] pizza: other than simple th igns like "he was better at last hitting creeps"
[6:16 PM] pizza: but that's not useful information or a new insight, because if you miss any creep, that's something to improve on, it's always something to improve
[6:17 PM] 공상: badger for example
[6:17 PM] 공상: when lach does game analysis
[6:17 PM] 공상: what it sounds like even to you
[6:17 PM] pizza: like I think TAW is a great example. Josh and I are at least 2k mmr in skill above most other TAW players, and even when we explicitly explain why they lost to us, they can't understand.
[6:17 PM] 공상: is what a 5k's analysis of an 8k players play would sound like to the 8k
[6:17 PM] pizza: like we're the high mmr players explaining how we won that game and they can't even understand
6:18 PM] A Random Badger: i still feel like thats more about them being ignorant rather than actually trying to understand tho lol
[6:18 PM] 공상: I disagree with the idea that dota is easy to look at and understand everything that's going on
[6:18 PM] pizza: ^^
[6:18 PM] pizza: completely agree
[6:18 PM] 공상: even I can't look at what gh did and understand why he's doing it
[6:18 PM] 공상: maybe vaguely
[6:19 PM] 공상: I can see what actually happened
[6:19 PM] 공상: I can't see his intentions
[6:19 PM] 공상: or what he's safeguarding against
[6:19 PM] 공상: or being proactive about
[6:19 PM] 공상: there's more to dota than what you can see
[6:19 PM] A Random Badger: again, as far as my go statement is concerned, im not talking about advanced level of play, im talking about absolute basic
[6:19 PM] 공상: you can definitely understand go basics by watching a couple games
[6:19 PM] pizza: oh i don't know shit about go so i won't speak on it
[6:20 PM] 공상: but that's not a worthwhile discussion
[6:20 PM] A Random Badger: uh we might have to try that by showing you a few games then lol
[6:20 PM] pizza: Not worth my time I think lol
[6:20 PM] 공상: because you think dota basics are way more basic than they are
[6:21 PM] A Random Badger: i do
[6:21 PM] 공상: you're comparing intermediate go concepts with fundamental dota concepts
[6:21 PM] 공상: imo
[6:21 PM] A Random Badger: and i think go fundamentals are also much more complicated and important the more you learn compared to dota
[6:21 PM] 공상: I think that betrays how little dota you understand
[6:22 PM] A Random Badger: oh no, i am intermediate player of go, i have not even gotten to the intermediate parts
[6:22 PM] 공상: or how easy you think picking it up is
[6:22 PM] 공상: have you ever tried to teach dota to a completely new player to the genre
[6:22 PM] pizza: You're not intermediate Dota player though
[6:22 PM] 공상: it's a fucking slog
[6:22 PM] 공상: they can't just watch dota and get it
[6:22 PM] 공상: hope doesn't even get it when she watches
[6:22 PM] 공상: sure it's easier to watch because there's nice animations
[6:23 PM] 공상: but she has no idea what's actually happening even on a basic level
[6:23 PM] 공상: of who's ahead and who's not
[6:23 PM] 공상: she goes by kill count
6:23 PM] A Random Badger: oh no....
[6:23 PM] 공상: which is like idk, going by stone captures in go
[6:24 PM] A Random Badger: yea i can agree with that lol
[6:24 PM] 공상: yeah
[6:24 PM] 공상: dota is far more complicated than I think you give it credit for
[6:24 PM] 공상: you're used to seeing it and you played league before
[6:24 PM] 공상: so you had starting ground to build on
[6:25 PM] 공상: she's played like 600 dota games and has no clue what's happening
[6:25 PM] A Random Badger: but i still remember what playing league for the first time was like lol
[6:25 PM] 공상: and she's a reasonably abovr average intelligence person
[6:25 PM] 공상: league is also much simpler flash browser game xd
[6:25 PM] A Random Badger: yes lol
[6:25 PM] 공상: like playing go on half the board with half the rules
[6:25 PM] 공상: makes learning the other half simple
[6:26 PM] 공상: simpler rather
[6:28 PM] A Random Badger: so i can understand why maybe i cant speak for the subject then considering how i started playing dota and how i started playing go, but keep in mind im only trying to compared the bare basics, which i think i undersand, of dota, and definitely of go, not the intermediate level
[6:28 PM] A Random Badger: also
[6:29 PM] A Random Badger: i have new friend who is experienced dota player and go player so i will consult his opinion lol
[6:30 PM] 공상: I really do think you think that the very basics of dota aka spell casting and moving are more involved than they are
[6:30 PM] 공상: which is why you took issue when I compared them to placing stones(edited)
[6:34 PM] A Random Badger: I can at least agree that the act of placing a stone is similar to the act of casting a spell or inputting a move or attack command. But I don't think it's equivalent to specifically "casting spell A or B"
[6:35 PM] 공상: what do you mean
[6:35 PM] A Random Badger: Which is why I pointed out the actual like intentions in a sense behind a move is more equivalent to casting spell A, etx
[6:37 PM] 공상: my whole point was, your actions in go are limited to "place stone at any open vertex " whereas dota has "cast one of your many spells or items on one of many possible targets, or move to any one of many possible places, or  push the stop key, or click on another unit etc etc"
[6:37 PM] 공상: those actions on their own aren't the end goal
[6:38 PM] 공상: like placing a stone isn't the goal of placing a stone and casting a spell isn't the point of casting a spell
[6:38 PM] 공상: but it's about the number of ways in which you can interact with the game state
[6:38 PM] 공상: ya dig?
[6:41 PM] 공상: it's like, casting a spell on dota can have a bunch of different intents: harassment, pushing a wave, setting up a kill, etc(edited)
[6:42 PM] 공상: just like placing a stone, in different contexts, becomes pincering or protecting or what have you
[12:20 AM] Coeurdleon: ive tried to teach basica level dota to people a number of times and its so easy to forget the first 200 hours you spent barely understanding how to lane and get experience
[12:28 AM] Coeurdleon: but a really good analogue to watching a 2k and a 4k player is a beginner in fighting games watching top level players.
at the basic beginner level, noone understands defence, so the person who uses a quick move thats hard to punish can just spam it and win. it doesnt matter how well they understand spacing and conditioning if they cant break grabs or block lows. the only reason conditioning works at a high level is because the other player has to respect your options because they know you can counter theirs if theyre not careful. if they know you cant deal with a good move they dont have to respect you and you'll just get steamrolled regardless of how good mechanically you are.
[12:29 AM] Coeurdleon: a new player will watch a top player just run in someones face and not get hit and be like "why doesnt the other guy just hit him"
[12:29 AM] Coeurdleon: and the reason is because the threat of a move is more powerful than a move itself
[12:30 AM] Coeurdleon: but someone who is new wont gain anything from that interaction because they cant understand the level of interaction between the players
[12:30 AM] Coeurdleon: so when there against someone good they try to hit the person running in their face and then just get whiff punished
[12:31 AM] Coeurdleon: or theyll try to punish something they dont realize is safe and get frame trapped
[12:31 AM] Coeurdleon: and they dont realize why theyre losing because theyre just getting steamrolled
[12:32 AM] Coeurdleon: it just feels like "their move just beats mine when mine  wins all the time in every other scenario against my friends"
[12:34 AM] Coeurdleon: the equivalent would be "he kills me when i approach the creep wave but i cant kill him when he approaches the creep wave"
[12:34 AM] Coeurdleon: and it could bebecause of creep control or position or only approaching when its to get high ground, or better item management or better farm or any other number of reasons
[12:35 AM] pizza: this is pretty spot on
[12:35 AM] Coeurdleon: but as a 2k player facing a 4k player all you can see is "he beat me"
12:35 AM] Coeurdleon: because hes like 3 layeres deeper than you and he knows that he doesnt have to respect your options
[12:35 AM] pizza: "he had more last hits" "he killed me"
[12:36 AM] Coeurdleon: because you dont even know what his options and actions are
[12:36 AM] Coeurdleon: you can only boil it down to what you understand which completely misses the point of how he actually beat you
[12:37 AM] pizza: like a 1k might lose lane because creepwave was always under safelane tower
[12:37 AM] pizza: and just assumes that the enemy was better at denying or something
[12:37 AM] pizza: but has no clue that pulling aggro to a ranged creep to have it push into you is a thing
[12:37 AM] pizza: he has no clue that that's what just happeend to him
[12:38 AM] pizza: so he loses to someone significantly better than him and still has no idea what it is that beat him in lane
[12:38 AM] pizza: and perhaps even assumes the wrong thing
[12:38 AM] Coeurdleon: or he doesnt realize that his auto attacks push the lane
[12:38 AM] 공상: even I didn't erally understand how I was losing mid when I'd get pushed under my tower until blitz explained it
[12:38 AM] pizza: yeah exactly
[12:38 AM] Coeurdleon: because for a long time you think "oh, tower is safety
[12:38 AM] Coeurdleon: im safe here"
[12:38 AM] pizza: and blitz is about 2k above fancy and me skillwise
[12:40 AM] Coeurdleon: that my 2¢ from a fighting gamers perspective
[12:40 AM] pizza: pretty spot on
[12:40 AM] pizza: and it is a good paralle
[12:41 AM] pizza: parallel
1:30 AM] Coeurdleon: Ooh, a really good straightforward example is a 50/50 when luigi wavedashes in he can either do a long range ftilt kick or he can get really close and grab. His ftilt is a good move and you have to respect it. If you dont hes going to hit you which leads into either stage control or a combo. The easiest way to respect it is to shield. If you shield, you can usually punish his kick on block but he can instead opt for a grab which is even better than landing a kick. The grab loses to basically any other option the opponent uses and is extremely punishable. 

A beginner luigi player watches a pro just repeatedly slide in and land juicy grabs to get massive punishes, because he has conditioned his opponent to respect the kick. The 2k player jumps into games and just fishes for grabs, but because the opponent doesn't have to respect a grab he gets wrecked. He doesn't realize that hes playing a mindgame that his opponent doesnt have to even consider. Hes not experienced enough to understand how the mindgame actually works even if he understands what is supposed to happen.

The opponent can tell them "grabbing is unsafe, do it less" as helpful advice but thats only more confusing because it seems so good when he sees better players than himself doing it repeatedly and succeeding

[9:18 AM] A Random Badger: I finally got 2nd opinion regarding the dota vs go debate if you'd like to see. I think you'd agree with it as well for the most part.
[9:23 AM] A Random Badger: He more accurately makes the points I tried to make as well regarding the place stone vs cast spell etc portion of the debate
[9:23 AM] A Random Badger: Tho he went with a different direction in it
[9:24 AM] A Random Badger: I won't bother you with it if you're not interested tho
[9:26 AM] fancy: I always argue sir

BADGER POSTS LIKE 20 FUCKING SCREENSHOTS

[9:29 AM] A Random Badger: That's all of it
[9:30 AM] A Random Badger: Also to respond to clip: LUL
[9:30 AM] A Random Badger: Even I saw that coming
[9:35 AM] A Random Badger: But yea he uses ai to address the point that both ai and human can understand and evaluate and address a board situation in dota much more easily compared to Go which might be the simple result of how like abstract the game is seeing as how's it's just stones on board or could just be the result that they're are so many more situations and scenarios and variations to keep in mind compared to dota.(edited)
[9:36 AM] A Random Badger: Of which I think it leans more towards the latter than just the abstractivenss of the game

Badger posts more fuckign screenshots

9:52 AM] A Random Badger: I think this is satisfactory resolution
[11:26 AM] fancy: the only thing I disagree with is that creating ai is easier for dota
[11:26 AM] A Random Badger: i dont think he meant it is easier to create
[11:27 AM] A Random Badger: i think he just means it is easier for ai to learn
[11:27 AM] A Random Badger: as far as the ai playing itself technique thing
[11:27 AM] fancy: perhaps
[11:27 AM] A Random Badger: which i think makes sense the way he put it
[11:27 AM] A Random Badger: the pc doesnt have like delayed reactions
[11:27 AM] A Random Badger: it ca react and calculate everything instantly
[11:28 AM] fancy: but yes
[11:28 AM] fancy: he basically said what I said
[11:28 AM] fancy: which are there are more ways to interact with game state
[11:28 AM] fancy: in dota
[11:28 AM] fancy: so your complexity tree looks different
[11:29 AM] A Random Badger: yes
[11:29 AM] A Random Badger: maybe not "more complex" but different complexity
[11:29 AM] A Random Badger: so you cant really compare
[11:29 AM] fancy: well that aspect is more complex
[11:29 AM] fancy: in terms of the entire game, idk they're just different
[11:29 AM] A Random Badger: wym then
[11:29 AM] A Random Badger: like as far as
[11:30 AM] A Random Badger: literally how you play the game
[11:30 AM] A Random Badger: mechanics wise?
[11:30 AM] A Random Badger: yea dota is more complex
[11:30 AM] A Random Badger: go you just put stone to board
11:30 AM] fancy: yes
[11:30 AM] fancy: that was what I was isolating
[11:30 AM] A Random Badger: ah i see
[11:30 AM] fancy: way back when we started this
[11:30 AM] A Random Badger: i thought you were making the point that like
[11:30 AM] A Random Badger: idk
[11:30 AM] fancy: when I was talking about breaking things down
[11:30 AM] A Random Badger: yes
[11:31 AM] A Random Badger: i was understanding it differently
[11:31 AM] A Random Badger: so yes learning how to place stone on board is easier than learning how to cast spells and abilities lol
[11:31 AM] A Random Badger: btw this guy is 4.5k he said
[11:31 AM] fancy: not easier
11:31 AM] A Random Badger: and 2D at go
[11:31 AM] fancy: all I meant was
[11:31 AM] fancy: the actual number of things you can do is smaller in go
[11:32 AM] fancy: which is inherently less complex
[11:32 AM] fancy: because at each point where you get to make a decision
[11:32 AM] fancy: your action is decided and you merely choose location
[11:32 AM] fancy: where in dota you have more actions etc
[11:33 AM] fancy: whether figuring out the game state is easier in dota or go, idk I didn't think about that part cus we got stuck on semantics lul
[11:33 AM] fancy: same for any other aspect we could compare
[11:34 AM] A Random Badger: yes but choosing a location and breaking them down and what not is extremely complex compared to choosing list of actions to take
[11:34 AM] fancy: perhaps
[11:34 AM] fancy: but in dota that equates to choosing where to be and when and who to cast what on when
[11:35 AM] fancy: do you hold you spell for 4 more seconds or do you throw it now
[11:35 AM] fancy: who do you throw it on
[11:35 AM] fancy: where do you stand in fights
[11:35 AM] fancy: etc
11:37 AM] A Random Badger: hmmm well i would say that playing around in specific portion of the board in Go and in Dota is equal. like do you play in top left corner or do bottom right, in dota do you farm in this lane, do you smoke in this direction, etc. where the specific location of where you play in go, pincering, invading, etc would be equivalent to the more specific i cast spell on this person, i stand here in fight, etcb
