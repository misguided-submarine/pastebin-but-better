[16:16 PM] A Random Badger: anyways here's what i think about the whole privilege debate, whether it's a white privilege or a an american/western privilege etc
[16:16 PM] A Random Badger: i think its a load a bullshit
[16:16 PM] A Random Badger: and heres why
[16:16 PM] A Random Badger: theres only arguably 1 goal in life that you can really use to show that you had a successful life
[16:17 PM] A Random Badger: and its a very simple thing
[16:17 PM] A Random Badger: happiness
[16:18 PM] fancy: wait woah
[16:18 PM] A Random Badger: the reason privilege is a load of bullshit no matter where you are is because you can be rich as bill gates and be depressed having every privilege in the world as far as gaining material things is concerned, but as has been proven many time already, material value has little to no impact on a person's happiness, neither does it on the flip side
[16:18 PM] fancy: what are we talking about
[16:18 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[16:18 PM] A Random Badger: im continuing this:
[16:18 PM] A Random Badger: ill cooy pase
[16:18 PM] fancy: where is this coming from
[16:19 PM] fancy: oh last night ?
[16:19 PM] A Random Badger: ye
[16:19 PM] A Random Badger: because what you absically mentioned was
[16:19 PM] A Random Badger: im privileged because im white male cis genered and straight
[16:19 PM] A Random Badger: is more or less what you tried to say
[16:19 PM] A Random Badger: and i think that means nothing
[16:19 PM] fancy: wew
[16:19 PM] fancy: this is a pretty big topic
[16:19 PM] A Random Badger: because theres are many people in the world
[16:19 PM] A Random Badger: in africa
[16:19 PM] A Random Badger: in india
[16:19 PM] A Random Badger: even america
[16:19 PM] fancy: and you're free to think that but it's pretty unarguable
[16:20 PM] A Random Badger: who are homeless and poor
[16:20 PM] A Random Badger: and are still able to find their happiness in life
[16:20 PM] A Random Badger: and some surely aren't
[16:20 PM] fancy: right but that's not really what priviledge means
[16:20 PM] A Random Badger: im not necessarily saying thats what it means
[16:20 PM] A Random Badger: im saying it has no impact on whether or not it impacts happiness
[16:21 PM] A Random Badger: which is arguably the only important thing in life
[16:21 PM] fancy: I'm pretty confident that isn't true
[16:21 PM] A Random Badger: many religious people in the past abandoned every mortal pleasure there was to become closer to god and found happiness in that
[16:21 PM] A Random Badger: not make it a religious thing but to use as an example
[16:22 PM] fancy: right so
[16:22 PM] A Random Badger: when someone is on deaths door
[16:22 PM] fancy: when we talk about things like this we talk in terms of generalities
[16:22 PM] A Random Badger: one of the primary things they think and talk about
[16:22 PM] A Random Badger: is how happy of a life they lived
[16:22 PM] A Random Badger: and they use that as their basis of success
[16:22 PM] A Random Badger: and their basis of regret
[16:23 PM] fancy: well you also can't really take 100% definitive stock in what dying people say because people by nature rationalize just about everything
[16:23 PM] fancy: hmm I need to drive home
[16:23 PM] A Random Badger: sure but theres no denying there is a vast majority of people on both ends of the "privilege" spectrum and are able to find happiness regardless yes?
[16:24 PM] fancy: uhhhh
[16:24 PM] fancy: I don't think that's substantiated
[16:24 PM] fancy: but we aren't really talking about possibility
[16:24 PM] A Random Badger: wym substantiated
[16:24 PM] fancy: like priviledge or lack of priviledge doesn't guarantee anything
[16:24 PM] fancy: like being black doesn't mean you can't succeed
[16:25 PM] A Random Badger: ofc
[16:25 PM] fancy: or being poor doesn't mean you can't succeed
[16:25 PM] A Random Badger: ofc
[16:25 PM] fancy: but generally speaking, traditionally, it's been easier for white males who are in the middle or upper class
[16:25 PM] A Random Badger: but also you dont have to succeed in a matter of materialism to be able to say you lived a successful life
[16:25 PM] fancy: because they're kinda the default, so-to-speak
[16:26 PM] A Random Badger: sure i can agree with that
[16:26 PM] fancy: and you also have to understand that people have different standards of happiness
[16:26 PM] A Random Badger: but even in this age
[16:26 PM] A Random Badger: theres mroe and more people dropping into the lower class from the middle class
[16:26 PM] A Random Badger: i would argue anyways
[16:26 PM] fancy: the general trend is that having no money makes you very unhappy, or at least makes it very much harder to
[16:27 PM] fancy: but having money doesn't guarantee you happiness
[16:27 PM] fancy: it just removes one obstacle
[16:27 PM] A Random Badger: i and most people around here are lower class citizens with middle and upper classes being the minority
[16:27 PM] fancy: well that's kinda how it always works
[16:27 PM] A Random Badger: yes
[16:27 PM] fancy: bell curves and standard distributions
[16:27 PM] fancy: etc
[16:27 PM] fancy: the proportions haven't really changed historically
[16:27 PM] fancy: as the standard of living increases
[16:28 PM] fancy: also I think you underestimate what middle class is
[16:28 PM] fancy: if your family owns a house and a car
[16:29 PM] fancy: you're probably at least lower middle class
[16:29 PM] A Random Badger: even still i would argue that materialistic things hold little to no weight when it comes to happiness so i would argue that its hardly an obstacle in the first place as you said ofc surely tho this depends on the standard of living in different countries
[16:30 PM] A Random Badger: an african man is most of the time plenty content and happy with his life even though we would generally see it as a sub par standard of living compared to the western society
[16:30 PM] A Random Badger: same in india and asia
[16:30 PM] fancy: hold on let me do thing
[16:30 PM] A Random Badger: i think china is actually a superb example
[16:31 PM] A Random Badger: china's a huge crowded country
[16:31 PM] A Random Badger: with very subpar living standards
[16:31 PM] A Random Badger: and a huge uh
[16:31 PM] A Random Badger: difference between the upper middle and lower classes
[16:31 PM] A Random Badger: siaperity
[16:31 PM] A Random Badger: disparity*
[16:31 PM] A Random Badger: was the word i was looking for
[16:32 PM] A Random Badger: i think
[16:32 PM] A Random Badger: yet there are actually plenty of chinese citizens who are plenty happy
[16:33 PM] A Random Badger: we've already established that each the lower class, usually regardless of country, is the majority of population
[16:33 PM] A Random Badger: idk exactly what the percentile would be
[16:34 PM] A Random Badger: but lets say 70% in lower class, 20% is middle class, well maybe be more generous and go 60% 30% but either way upper class would probably be around the 10% range
[16:34 PM] fancy: uh that's not right
[16:34 PM] A Random Badger: either way
[16:34 PM] fancy: middle class is the biggest
[16:34 PM] A Random Badger: its just an example
[16:35 PM] A Random Badger: switch it then
[16:35 PM] A Random Badger: 30-35% lower
[16:35 PM] A Random Badger: 55-60 middle
[16:35 PM] A Random Badger: 10% upper
[16:36 PM] A Random Badger: i would argue that regardless of those percentiles that make up the total population, the percentile of each of those classes as far as achievements by happiness is all roughly around the same percentile where i would even argue that the upper class would probably have even slightly lower than the other 2 just because of the nature of having less people within your percentile to work with
[16:37 PM] fancy: so that's not really a useful assertion
[16:37 PM] fancy: because what are your qualifications for making that assessment
[16:38 PM] A Random Badger: if thats the stance you want to make then lets each go to college for the next 8 years about it and then come back to discuss this
[16:39 PM] A Random Badger: because thats the only reliable way to actually use that stance
[16:39 PM] A Random Badger: because even researching articles online do not give you a proper qualification to discuss it
[16:39 PM] A Random Badger: because many of them have biases
[16:39 PM] fancy: no
[16:39 PM] fancy: that's not exactly right
[16:39 PM] fancy: I'm driving one sec
[16:41 PM] A Random Badger: i think it is right, it is very hard to find an article without bias or funds from a particular organization which do hold a bias or agenda
[16:42 PM] A Random Badger: thats just the nature of it
[16:42 PM] A Random Badger: because politicians and media always want to persuade and push a specific agenda onto their consumers/followers
[16:42 PM] fancy: that's true
[16:42 PM] fancy: but that doesn't mean you can just make your own conclusions from data
[16:43 PM] A Random Badger: sure but even those have biases to push agendas
[16:44 PM] A Random Badger: like the nra funding Harvard university to write an article about a very specific data set in order to validate an argument that supports their agenda
[16:44 PM] fancy: what
[16:44 PM] fancy: data doesn't lie(edited)
[16:44 PM] fancy: data is data
[16:45 PM] A Random Badger: not if you can compile and look at it all on a large scale
[16:45 PM] A Random Badger: but most data sets dont do that
[16:45 PM] A Random Badger: the data doesnt lie
[16:45 PM] A Random Badger: sure
[16:46 PM] A Random Badger: but a specific data set that only talks about a specific topic can be uh taken a different way
[16:47 PM] A Random Badger: a perfect example is regarding gun control
[16:47 PM] A Random Badger: and how both sides wanted to prove that gun control works by using the australia argument
[16:47 PM] fancy: so data doesn't do any of that
[16:47 PM] fancy: that's the point
[16:47 PM] fancy: when I get home in moving this to the other chat btw
[16:48 PM] A Random Badger: so each side would fund a university to compile a list of data to validate a specific argument. for example on the left side they compiled data that showed post gun ban violent crime decreased. on the right side they compiled data that showed that certain aspects of violent crime held peaks post ban
[16:49 PM] A Random Badger: both data sets were technically correct
[16:49 PM] A Random Badger: but neither told the whole story individually
[16:49 PM] A Random Badger: in fact they weren't really able to come to a valuable unbiased conclusion until they took an entire data set all centered around violent crimes and the effects of the gun ban/buy back
[16:50 PM] A Random Badger: and then compared it to the USA's entire data set of violent crime since the same date
[16:50 PM] A Random Badger: and they found that while Australia's violent crime decreased and also sometimes held peaks
[16:51 PM] A Random Badger: the USA's did so in almost a parallel manner
[16:51 PM] A Random Badger: the USA followed a very similar decrease in violent crime even though they never instituted such a gun ban or buy back over the same period of time
[16:51 PM] A Random Badger: and also found similar peaks in certain aspects of violent crime
[16:51 PM] A Random Badger: which were simply found to just be
[16:52 PM] A Random Badger: "statistical anomalies"
[16:52 PM] A Random Badger: and the decrease of violent crime was found to not have been affected by the Australia gun by back program but rather, it just declined at the natural rate it already had been doing
[16:54 PM] fancy: okay I'm home one sec
[16:54 PM] A Random Badger: this is perfect example of how you can still manipulate an arguement to fit a bias or agenda by only showing portions of an entire data set
[16:54 PM] A Random Badger: this is perfect example of how you can still manipulate an arguement to fit a bias or agenda by only showing portions of an entire data set
[4:57 PM] A Random Badger: and yanno what, australia no longer has banned guns for the msot part tho they still have their own aspect of gun control over it because even they found that by simply buying and banning guns held no substantial effect on violent crime in their country and this was a conversation i had online with an australian citizen who was part of TAW who currently owns a gun and lived through the situation
[16:57 PM] fancy: okay I move this now
