[12:52 PM] pizza: but they gave us a month of pay
[12:52 PM] pizza: which is pretty unexpected
[12:52 PM] fancy: mm
[12:53 PM] fancy: yeah it's pretty cool of them to do
[12:54 PM] fancy: I'm honestly like
[12:54 PM] fancy: morbidly curious
[12:54 PM] pizza: m?
[12:54 PM] fancy: to see what happens with all this
[12:54 PM] pizza: yeah
[12:54 PM] pizza: i was just talking to my mom about it
[12:54 PM] fancy: kinda rooting for the virus
[12:54 PM] fancy: lol
[12:54 PM] pizza: and how even after all this eventually blows over
[12:54 PM] pizza: it's going to permanently change how people act in public
[12:54 PM] fancy: uhh
[12:55 PM] fancy: not sure about that one tbh
[12:55 PM] fancy: not for very long at lesat
[12:55 PM] pizza: well yeah
[12:55 PM] pizza: people are big dum
[12:55 PM] pizza: permanently probably a bit strong
[12:56 PM] pizza: but man next time i go to a bar people are gonna be super fucking careful still i think
[12:56 PM] fancy: more like
[12:56 PM] pizza: also, i feel bad for asian people lol
[12:56 PM] fancy: people don't care
[12:56 PM] fancy: about anything that isn't right in front of them
[12:56 PM] pizza: i've gone to kroger and seen people fucking YEET away because they saw an asian family
[12:56 PM] fancy: people very stupid
[12:56 PM] fancy: our president
[12:56 PM] fancy: also very stupid
[12:57 PM] fancy: idk
[12:57 PM] fancy: honestly what i can't wait for
[12:57 PM] fancy: is round 2
[12:57 PM] fancy: because we're trying so hard to keep everyone from getting it
[12:57 PM] fancy: at some point
[12:57 PM] fancy: everyone is going to get it
[12:57 PM] fancy: that's just how it works
[12:57 PM] fancy: lol
[12:57 PM] fancy: also the whole massive economic damage
[12:57 PM] pizza: ik we dont' talk politics
[12:57 PM] pizza: but
[12:57 PM] pizza: i'm gonna be a bit upset if all the bernie supporters choose to not vote for biden instead
[12:58 PM] pizza: and yeah
[12:58 PM] pizza: it
[12:58 PM] fancy: I'm like 100% sure it doesn't matter who we pick
[12:58 PM] pizza: i think it's gonna get pretty bad simply because we're not taking it seriously enough
[12:58 PM] fancy: cus I'm like 99% sure it's all the same
[12:58 PM] pizza: the fact that we're talking about reopening the country in 2 weeks
[12:58 PM] pizza: is fucking absurd
[12:58 PM] fancy: lol
[12:58 PM] fancy: I mean
[12:58 PM] fancy: imo
[12:58 PM] fancy: shouldn't have closed it
[12:58 PM] pizza: gotta love all the millionaires saying that we need to get outside and start working
[12:59 PM] pizza: like okay how about you work at mcdonalds for a few weeks with no mask or gloves and then say we need to open
[12:59 PM] fancy: we kinda do
[12:59 PM] fancy: you can't just stop the economy
[12:59 PM] fancy: economic inertia is huge
[12:59 PM] fancy: like
[12:59 PM] fancy: VERY
[12:59 PM] fancy: huge
[12:59 PM] pizza: i think if we simply did a national freeze of mortgage and rent things would be so much better
[12:59 PM] pizza: it's nto perfect
[12:59 PM] fancy: that's far from perfect
[12:59 PM] pizza: but would have been better than 1200 dollar checks to some people
[1:00 PM] pizza: well yeah
[1:00 PM] fancy: that's probably equally useless imo
[1:00 PM] fancy: what about all the people who make their money off rent and shit
[1:00 PM] pizza: you mean landlords, most of whom are well in the 1%?
[1:00 PM] pizza: they also won't have to pay rent or mortgage for their own assets
[1:01 PM] fancy: you also can't really just do that
[1:01 PM] fancy: just because there's a crisis doesn't mean upkeep costs go away
[1:01 PM] fancy: everything is connected
[1:01 PM] fancy: pausing any part of the economy can have massive repercussions on things you never thought about
[1:02 PM] pizza: true
[1:02 PM] fancy: utility demand will go up since more people at home more of the time
[1:02 PM] fancy: the more these things are used the more maintenance there needs to be
[1:02 PM] fancy: on top of more needing to be produced
[1:02 PM] fancy: just one example
[1:03 PM] pizza: but i think prioritizing reopening rn is essentially saying that hundreds of thousands of more deaths is worth getting started sooner
[1:03 PM] pizza: and if anything, that many people dying would be just as detrimental to the economy as staying at home for a few extra weeks
[1:03 PM] pizza: especially in a country where people can barely afford treatment
[1:03 PM] fancy: it's more complicated than that
[1:04 PM] fancy: because while there is the "upside" of everyone staying home to keep from getting sick
[1:04 PM] fancy: that causes people to lose jobs
[1:04 PM] fancy: which can be just as harmful
[1:04 PM] fancy: as getting sick
[1:04 PM] fancy: like yeah we save lives in the short term
[1:04 PM] fancy: but do we really net come out ahead
[1:04 PM] fancy: really hard to say
[1:04 PM] fancy: depends how much damage is done
[1:04 PM] pizza: okay but, when you think about why people need to be laid off, a mortgage/rent freeze would do wonders for that
[1:05 PM] fancy: once again, not that simple
[1:05 PM] fancy: as well, if businesses lay people off and close
[1:05 PM] fancy: those jobs are gone
[1:05 PM] fancy: they don't come back instantly
[1:06 PM] fancy: like say every fast food joint lays everyone off and has to close down for several months
[1:06 PM] fancy: that drastically affects the demand for raw product
[1:06 PM] fancy: which affects the agriculture industry
[1:06 PM] fancy: which affects the transportation industry
[1:07 PM] fancy: which affects everyone that needs to maintain roads/planes/trucks/trains
[1:07 PM] fancy: like the economy wasn't designed to be able to just pause
[1:07 PM] fancy: it only works because it keeps moving
[1:07 PM] fancy: it's like how farmers are having to just destroy product at this point because of the huge reduction in demand
[1:08 PM] fancy: and they don't have the infrastructure to just store it
[1:08 PM] fancy: but animals still produce
[1:08 PM] fancy: and still have to eat
[1:08 PM] fancy: it's a very very complicated problem to try to solve
[1:08 PM] fancy: and really what needed to be done
[1:08 PM] fancy: was to be prepared to handle this kind of health crisis in advance
[1:08 PM] fancy: instead of having it hit us and suddenly
[1:08 PM] fancy: oh shit
[1:09 PM] fancy: we had no plan for this
[1:09 PM] pizza: i think most reasonable people agree with that bit lol
[1:10 PM] pizza: trumpyboi was so preoccupied with saving face
[1:10 PM] fancy: well yeah but most reasonable people aren't in charge of the country
[1:10 PM] pizza: like i distinctly remember watching the original press releases live
[1:10 PM] pizza: where an expert would go up on the podium and say "there are a few cases, and it's inevitable that it's going to spread"
[1:10 PM] fancy:

[1:10 PM] pizza: and trump would literally go up to the podium 15 seconds later and say things like "
[1:11 PM] pizza: "we have 15 cases, they're all getting better, and i mean, it's soon going to be 0 cases, so we're doing a great job folks"
[1:11 PM] pizza: and putting mike pence in charge of the covid task force
[1:11 PM] pizza: :thinking:
[1:14 PM] fancy: don't forget ivanka was on it too
[1:14 PM] fancy: :02XD~1:
[1:14 PM] fancy: god bless us
[1:14 PM] pizza: and JARED
[1:14 PM] fancy: idk who jared is
[1:14 PM] fancy: but I have never known a good jared
[1:14 PM] fancy: so
[1:14 PM] pizza: no one knows who jared is
