[12:13 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Welcome to Uni, where the grades are subjective and professors do whatever the fuck
[12:13 PM] Suck it, Moto!: ooooo
[12:13 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Okay lemme spell this out for ya
[12:13 PM] Suck it, Moto!: The test was worth 185 points right
[12:15 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I got 169.37/185 or 92%. not bad. Since I've done all the homework that's a comfortable A.
[12:15 PM] Suck it, Moto!: HOWEVER
[12:15 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Dr. Manly decides to be a merciful god
[12:16 PM] Suck it, Moto!: and sends this email last night
[12:16 PM] Suck it, Moto!: 

[12:17 PM] Suck it, Moto!: "The average score on the exam was lower than I would like."
[12:17 PM] Suck it, Moto!: So she just decides OH I KNOW I'll just fucking hand them 20 free points
[12:18 PM] Suck it, Moto!: because the bonus assignment she created has unlimited tries and is open book.
[12:18 PM] Suck it, Moto!: SO
[12:18 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Because my uni doesnt do A+ A- or anything, just ABCDF
[12:19 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Someone who got 146.5/185, or 79% on the test could get an A (90%) on the test's final grade by doing the free assignment. C => A
[12:19 PM] Suck it, Moto!: cuz why not
[12:20 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Literally de-values my A
[12:20 PM] Suck it, Moto!: @Coeurdleon
[12:20 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Everyone needs to see this shit
[12:20 PM] Suck it, Moto!: @Subhanshu
[12:21 PM] Suck it, Moto!: @Howdy
[12:21 PM] Suck it, Moto!: @A Random Badger
[12:22 PM] Howdy: Happens all the time, gotta get that nice bell curve distribution
[12:22 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I dont understand why tho
[12:23 PM] Suck it, Moto!: is it just to prevent herself from looking bad bc too many people got D's and F's?
[12:23 PM] A Random Badger: most likely
[12:24 PM] A Random Badger: and maybe to just help out the people who genuinely have trouble understanding the subject
[12:24 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I mean if you get a bad grade you get a bad grade
[12:24 PM] Suck it, Moto!: you have no one to blame but yourself
[12:25 PM] A Random Badger: when i took programming, i could hardly understand no matter how hard i tried, easily failed teh class and did the worst of everyone because I genuinely could not wrap my head around it but my teacher passed me anyways so that I would still get the credits I needed to graduate(edited)
[12:25 PM] A Random Badger: some teachers are just like that
[12:28 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Was CompSci your major? Because I can understand that if it was a non-major req and programming wasn't going to be relevant to your major. But Everyone in this accounting class is an accounting major or finance major
[12:29 PM] Suck it, Moto!: If a student can't perform tasks that display the approprate proficiency they shouldn't get the highest possible grade
[12:30 PM] A Random Badger: then yea thats different
[12:31 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I also know for a fact of 2 people that cheated on the test so there's that too
[12:32 PM] fancy: who cares though
[12:32 PM] fancy: people cheat all the time
[12:32 PM] fancy: it's life
[12:32 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Why is it always the goddamn chinese
[12:32 PM] fancy: rude
[12:34 PM] A Random Badger: but yea ive yet to go to college btw lol i took a bunch of college level courses in high school like compsci and engineering courses under the pltw program that gave me credits towards college and of course my high school graduation, at the time i was seeking an electrical or nuclear engineering degree so compsci definitely wasnt going to affect me much but i still needed to pass for the credits to graduate high school since i was interested in taking another american history course or smth stupid liek that
[12:35 PM] A Random Badger: wasnt*
[12:35 PM] Suck it, Moto!: That makes sense
[12:35 PM] Suck it, Moto!: My uni has a very large chinese international student population. There's always 3 or 4 in my business classes and several more in summer classes because they often dont go home during the summer. With all my integrity I swear I haven't gone into an accounting test where I haven't seen a chinese student cheating since December
[12:36 PM] Suck it, Moto!: not rude if it's true
[12:36 PM] fancy: and I'm sure white people cheat too
[12:37 PM] Suck it, Moto!: definetly
[12:37 PM] A Random Badger: lol you should check out the competition in the nuclear field
[12:37 PM] fancy: so it's not always the Chinese
[12:37 PM] fancy: so don't say that
[12:37 PM] Suck it, Moto!: it's disporportionately often the chinese
[12:37 PM] Suck it, Moto!: there
[12:37 PM] fancy: perhaps
[12:37 PM] fancy: questionable
[12:38 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Either that or they are just the worst at hiding it
[12:38 PM] Suck it, Moto!: in which case
[12:38 PM] Suck it, Moto!: get gud
[12:39 PM] fancy: what I don't understand is why that has to ruin your time
[12:39 PM] fancy: you got an A
[12:39 PM] fancy: you achieved
[12:39 PM] fancy: who gives a fuck what anyone else does
[12:40 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Yes ultimately Everything is ok for me because I'm doing well. so me complaining here is minor. But it is sad to see that people are getting the same grade as me that didn't earn it
[12:40 PM] fancy: why is that sad
[12:40 PM] fancy: and you seem more angry than sad
[12:42 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Because I feel my time spent studying and actaully paying attention in class is wasted. These other folks are just on their phones all class and instead of getting the grades that earns you (C/B) they get bailed out by the professors for no good reason
[12:42 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Like
[12:43 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Say you work really hard to learn and control the spray pattern of the AK in CSGO
[12:43 PM] fancy: it wasn't wasted if you learned it
[12:43 PM] fancy: it's not about the grade
[12:43 PM] fancy: unless you make it about the grade
[12:43 PM] Suck it, Moto!: And you because really good at it, significantly better than other people
[12:44 PM] Suck it, Moto!: and then valve dumbed it down so that it takes significantly lss skill and practice to use
[12:45 PM] Suck it, Moto!: so during a CSGO tourny just after You're committed is rewarded the same as someone who didnt practice at all
[12:45 PM] fancy: but school isn't a competition though
[12:45 PM] fancy: that's where this is kinda a stretch
[12:46 PM] Suck it, Moto!: The grade matters because folks have to maintain gpa for tens of thousands in scholarship money and your gpa matters after undergrad
[12:46 PM] Suck it, Moto!: school is a competition
[12:46 PM] fancy: it is not
[12:46 PM] fancy: that is a poor way to look at it
[12:46 PM] fancy: the bottom of the class at Harvard is still a lawyer
[12:46 PM] fancy: jobs may be a competition
[12:47 PM] fancy: careers may be competitive
[12:47 PM] fancy: but learning isn't
[12:47 PM] fancy: education isn't
[12:47 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Well an employer looking at two applicants will choose the one with a better undergrad GPA if everything else is constant right?
[12:47 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Grades arent everything
[12:47 PM] Suck it, Moto!: but they matter
[12:48 PM] fancy: possibly
[12:48 PM] fancy: how often do you have two identical applicants though
[12:49 PM] Suck it, Moto!: You know that doesnt actaully perfectly happen, it's just to demonstrate that it is a factor when evaluating applicants
[12:49 PM] Suck it, Moto!: cmon lol
[12:49 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Grades matter for me I should say
[12:49 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Like if I got all C's I would lose scholarship money and I wouldnt be able to go to school anymore
[12:49 PM] Suck it, Moto!: so
[12:50 PM] Suck it, Moto!: yeah it's important to me
[12:50 PM] Suck it, Moto!: A large portion of the student body is on merit based financial aid so it's not just me either
[12:51 PM] fancy: but what I'm saying is
[12:52 PM] fancy: why does it matter to you
[12:52 PM] fancy: what the other people do
[12:52 PM] fancy: does it affect you at all?
[12:52 PM] fancy: aren't they actually losing out
[12:53 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Yes ultaimtely they are hurting themselves by not learning, but on paper, My achievments would appear the same as those who obtained them by illegitimate means
[12:54 PM] fancy: right, but so?
[12:54 PM] fancy: it'll come back to them eventually
[12:55 PM] fancy: is it worth being mad about
[12:55 PM] Suck it, Moto!: yes, but for the time being it devalues my work
[12:55 PM] Suck it, Moto!: and dpeending on at what time that work is assessed it could make a difference
[12:55 PM] Howdy: Getting into the system is hard
[12:55 PM] Howdy: But it's true that a good student will keep their job while a phony will loose it
[12:56 PM] Howdy: It's just getting a foot in the door that is so hard
[12:56 PM] fancy: not even
[12:56 PM] fancy: you don't have to be a good student
[12:56 PM] fancy: because good student isn't the same
[12:56 PM] fancy: as good employee
[12:56 PM] fancy: right
[12:56 PM] fancy: I'm an awful student
[12:56 PM] fancy: I'm a great employee
[12:56 PM] Suck it, Moto!: If you're resourceful enough to cheat you can probably figure a job out in time not to get fired for incompetence
[12:56 PM] Howdy: For a top-tier job in the Chem E field they can afford to filter apps with anything lower than a 3.9 GPA and lots of extracurriculars
[12:57 PM] fancy: so what's the real loss here
[12:57 PM] fancy: seems to me if they are still able to succeed
[12:57 PM] fancy: they're the real winners for figuring out how to play the game better
[12:57 PM] fancy: ya know
[12:57 PM] Howdy: :Thinky:
[12:57 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I can't believe you're saying cheaters desreve to win lol
[12:58 PM] fancy: I didn't say deserved
[12:58 PM] fancy: no one deserves anything
[12:58 PM] fancy: I've always said that
[12:58 PM] fancy: but you figure out how to play the game best first
[12:58 PM] fancy: you're going to win
[12:59 PM] Suck it, Moto!: So if you encounter a hacker in CSGO there's no reason to be mad bc hey if they figure out how to play the game better by any means it means they earned it
[12:59 PM] fancy: that's not the same because the end goal of csgo is csgo
[12:59 PM] fancy: the end goal of school isn't school
[12:59 PM] fancy: they didn't win school
[12:59 PM] fancy: they might "win" their career though
[1:00 PM] fancy: like hacking in csgo means you're not actually achieving in csgo
[1:00 PM] Howdy: The end goal of school is school if you wanna work in academia :Thinktato:
[1:00 PM] fancy: well yes Trevor
[1:00 PM] fancy: but the goal of classes isnt to get good at taking classes
[1:00 PM] Howdy: Actually, that's a valuable skill to have
[1:00 PM] fancy: it's to learn enough and check enough arbitrary boxes so people will hire you
[1:01 PM] Howdy: Learning and getting good at learning
[1:01 PM] fancy: I didn't contest that Trevor
[1:01 PM] fancy: and those aren't one and the same
[1:01 PM] fancy: I'm bad at taking classes
[1:01 PM] Suck it, Moto!: This is just an example of Josh saying whatever arguements disagrees. There is no agreeing with this man. Is this a game to you?
[1:01 PM] fancy: I'm good at learning and figuring things out
[1:01 PM] fancy: look there you go again Andrew
[1:01 PM] fancy: now you're attacking me
[1:01 PM] fancy: stop it
[1:01 PM] fancy: think about what I'm saying
[1:02 PM] Howdy: :oncoming_police_car: :octagonal_sign:
[1:02 PM] fancy: what is the goal of a career
[1:03 PM] Howdy: I think that can depend
[1:03 PM] fancy: expand
[1:03 PM] Howdy: Usually it's either 1.) To make money or 2.) To find meaning
[1:03 PM] fancy: Pretty accurate I think
[1:03 PM] fancy: would you agree Andrew
[1:04 PM] Howdy: A healthy job should be both
[1:04 PM] fancy: perhaps the ideal job yes
[1:04 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I just dont understand why you so frequently take positions in arguements against me. It happens 99% of the time and it's just too often to accept as coincidence
[1:04 PM] fancy: because you argue from emotion a lot of the time andrew
[1:04 PM] fancy: ie
[1:04 PM] fancy: "I don't like this so it's stupid "
[1:04 PM] fancy: and I am the opposite so that you'll think about what you're saying
[1:05 PM] Suck it, Moto!: So you just go against me on everything out of spite?
[1:05 PM] fancy: you think i hate you because I want you to consider other pics?
[1:05 PM] fancy: povs*
[1:06 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Clearly you hate me for  some reason
[1:06 PM] Howdy: I think it would be for the 2 spaces between "for" and "some"
[1:06 PM] fancy: i disagree with a lot of what you say
[1:06 PM] fancy: this is true
[1:07 PM] fancy: and I dislike some of the things you do
[1:07 PM] fancy: I don't hate you
[1:08 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Well get used to it. Im not going to waste energy trying to please you
[1:08 PM] Suck it, Moto!: you're impossible
[1:09 PM] Subhanshu: This is a dense morning.
[1:09 PM] Howdy: I know I had a shit where it all came out in one moment
[1:10 PM] Howdy: Fruit crepes can do that
[1:10 PM] fancy: was your goal ever to please me
[1:10 PM] fancy: I certainly don't expect you ti
[1:10 PM] fancy: to
[1:10 PM] fancy: I think if I hated you I wouldn't try to share other perspectives
[1:10 PM] fancy: I'd treat you like spikes
[1:10 PM] fancy: who is someone I actually hate
[1:11 PM] Howdy: an old boss?
[1:12 PM] fancy: no
[1:12 PM] fancy: friend of ashley
[1:12 PM] Subhanshu: SPOKESPOGLE
[1:12 PM] Subhanshu: THE LEGEND
[1:13 PM] fancy: no dude
[1:13 PM] fancy: he's a piece of shit
[1:13 PM] fancy: no redeeming qualities
[1:13 PM] Subhanshu: He had two hands
[1:14 PM] fancy: not even close
[1:14 PM] fancy: you can't redeem him
[1:14 PM] fancy: it's not possible
[1:14 PM] Howdy: He gives you an example of someone you hate :SuperThinking:
[1:15 PM] Subhanshu: That's redeeming
[1:15 PM] fancy: not even close dude
[1:15 PM] fancy: it is not
[1:15 PM] fancy: I don't want people i hate
[1:15 PM] fancy: that's depressing
[1:15 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Doesnt feel like you want me
[1:15 PM] Suck it, Moto!: You dont touch me anymore
[1:15 PM] fancy: you read it wrong again sir
[1:16 PM] fancy: I don't want to have people I hate
[1:16 PM] fancy: I don't want to hate people
[1:16 PM] fancy: it's a reluctant hatred
[1:16 PM] fancy: I don't touch anyone dude
