[9:52 PM] fancy: but idk
[9:52 PM] fancy: I think she's entertaining
[9:52 PM] A Random Badger: my first impression with her was her league of legends advertisement which was god awful(edited)
[9:53 PM] A Random Badger: plus from back in my league hay day
[9:53 PM] A Random Badger: she was always a real popular league streamer i think
[9:53 PM] A Random Badger: i heard about her alot
[9:53 PM] fancy: she's just a generic streamer
[9:53 PM] fancy: she didn't blow up until IRL happened
[9:53 PM] fancy: cus she's not good at video games
[9:53 PM] fancy: she's like
[9:53 PM] fancy: really bad
[9:53 PM] fancy: even at like
[9:53 PM] fancy: The Sims
[9:54 PM] A Random Badger: lol
[9:54 PM] A Random Badger: yea i just have negative opinion of her cause of the lol ad
[9:54 PM] A Random Badger: i think
[9:54 PM] fancy: iduno
[9:54 PM] A Random Badger: have you ever seen it
[9:54 PM] fancy: no
[9:54 PM] A Random Badger: its bad
[9:54 PM] fancy: why would I watch league ads
[9:54 PM] A Random Badger: well
[9:55 PM] A Random Badger: sometimes adblock breaks itself and lets youtube run ads

[9:55 PM] fancy: I haven't seen an ad in years
[9:55 PM] A Random Badger: witness how terrible it is
[9:55 PM] fancy: I mean
[9:55 PM] fancy: it's league
[9:56 PM] fancy: it has no selling points
[9:56 PM] fancy: it's really hard to sell garbage
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: i think i just look down on the uh
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: innocent ignorance of league players
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: "innocent ignorance"
[9:57 PM] fancy: u look down on a lot of things
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: idk what to use
[9:58 PM] A Random Badger: mainly things league related xd
[9:58 PM] A Random Badger: and league players xd
[9:59 PM] A Random Badger: she's prob a cool person but uh yea i just cant move past the "innocent ignorance of league players" for lack of a better description
[9:59 PM] fancy: I don't know what that means
[10:00 PM] A Random Badger: uh i could elaborate but i dont want to like flood you with my haphazard unintelligible explanations
[10:00 PM] A Random Badger: which they usually end up being
[10:01 PM] A Random Badger: uh the short explanation would be
[10:01 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[10:02 PM] A Random Badger: how most league players are just very ignorant to an almost crime-like abuse that riot games uses on its game, its players base, its professionals, its esports employees, especially the esport employees, and other things
[10:02 PM] fancy: I'm sure that's true of like
[10:02 PM] fancy: 90% of companies
[10:02 PM] fancy: I'm sure u still buy things from Nestle
[10:03 PM] A Random Badger: no i am also unaware of what they did and i prob wont once i learn xd
[10:03 PM] fancy: I mean
[10:03 PM] fancy: the poitn is you can't
[10:03 PM] fancy: do you know how many things nestle owns
[10:03 PM] A Random Badger: true
[10:03 PM] fancy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands
List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands

[10:03 PM] A Random Badger: and this is why i target riot a lot more in general
[10:03 PM] fancy: they're equally if not more scummy than riot
[10:03 PM] A Random Badger: cause they dont have this defense
[10:03 PM] fancy: this isn't a defense
[10:03 PM] A Random Badger: they are solely responsible for one game
[10:03 PM] fancy: this is just business
[10:04 PM] A Random Badger: defense wrong word i know
[10:04 PM] fancy: tbh I'm all for people getting taken advantage of
[10:04 PM] A Random Badger: what i meant tho is
[10:10 PM] A Random Badger: there are companies who do things just as bad or worse things, but as you said its difficult to rag on them for multiple reasons including, for really big companies like nestle, many of their even more numerous employees and managers and designers are innocent and they try their best to do what they can and provide good products, they also have the fact that they simply produce so many well received products its hard to convince yourself to stop buying all of those products all together as a uh boycott ig where riot games is a much smaller company and is solely responsible for one product, and while the same can be said that surely a good amount of their employees and managers and design team have good intentions, in this case i dont think it actually outweighs the support of one product if you know what i mean so i target riot games much more than i would target nestle because riot games is much mroe down on a level where you can actually achieve something by confronting them for their actions and possibly convince them to change their ways where you can't really do that with nestle and theres a larger risk of destroying the lives of much more innocent people who are involved in that company if it were to say go under, simply put thats a lot more jobs lost not to mention product
[10:10 PM] A Random Badger: imho anyways
[10:14 PM] fancy: pretty sure that most of the things nestle does are way more morally questionable than anything riot has ever done
[10:15 PM] A Random Badger: thats why i look down on league players who are ignorant of these corrupt business models and intents that are very blatant because they could all shake their fist and tell them to start treating people better but instead they pretend these problems dont exist and to be perfectly honest, enable such a toxic and corrupt business ethic
[10:15 PM] A Random Badger: well like i said its not about the severity of morally questionable actions
[10:15 PM] A Random Badger: its about what are the things within a realm of possibility of accomplishment
[10:15 PM] fancy: well not really
[10:15 PM] fancy: because this is how the world in general works
[10:15 PM] fancy: most people are oblivious to a lot of things
[10:16 PM] fancy: like you are about companies like Nestle
[10:16 PM] fancy: at the end of the day
[10:16 PM] fancy: it doesn't really matter
[10:16 PM] fancy: plus it's not even agreed on what "treating people better" even means
[10:16 PM] fancy: that's a pretty subjective thign
[10:17 PM] fancy: so I think looking down on people for something like
[10:17 PM] fancy: continuing to support riot by playing league
[10:17 PM] fancy: is kinda silly
[10:18 PM] fancy: I don't think that a good reason we shouldn't confront Nestle for their actions is because more people will lose their jobs if the company were to go under
[10:24 PM] A Random Badger: well first of all, i think this has more merit when its considered that im oblivious about the wrong doings of incorporations that i actually follow and support unlike nestle of which i hardly follow, and don't just buy their products because i think they're a great company, i buy it because its just whats available for a decent price and you can make the same comparison to league, ofc i dont look down on the casual player who doesnt really follow everything riot games does and the scene of league of legends in general, however i do look down on public figures who have connections with the company and follow their actions much more closely to the point that they would know about these morally questionable ethics but simply either dont care about or dont give any ounce of attention or thought towards. i think this is an important distinction to make. comparatively there are many key figures who speak out about the wrong doings of riot games, had the experience and the evidence of their wrong doings and the justification for why they were wrong doings and yet as i have said other figures simply don't pay mind to because their either ignorant, lazy, or just as corrupt
[10:27 PM] A Random Badger: and thats why i loosely look down on someone like lilypichu because she has the connections and the experience with working with riot games and employees and has been exposed to some of these "morally grey" areas, if that is the correct phrase, yet simply remains oblivious due w.e it might be
[10:28 PM] fancy: that sounds questionable
[10:28 PM] fancy: pretty sure most people dont' give a fuck abotu most thigns
[10:28 PM] fancy: yourself included
[10:28 PM] fancy: I dont' think being a public figure somehow makes you more responsible
[10:29 PM] A Random Badger: then maybe this is just my own unique expectation of people
[10:30 PM] A Random Badger: i expect people to care about things like these given they care about the source
[10:30 PM] A Random Badger: so to speak
[10:30 PM] A Random Badger: i expect them to care about the wrong doings of riot games if they care about riot games as an example
[10:30 PM] A Random Badger: i expect them to care about the wrong doings of nestle if they care about nestle
[10:31 PM] fancy: don't think she cares about riot
[10:31 PM] A Random Badger: and i view it as wrong to not care about the bads and only the goods
[10:31 PM] fancy: think she cares about money
[10:33 PM] A Random Badger: maybe but i dont think she would go out on a whim to do things like adverts for riot games "for fun" with no guarantee of money if she didn't care about riot games/league of legends
[10:34 PM] A Random Badger: if i cared about money i certainly wouldnt waste my time to go do a community collaboration at riot games just for the heck of it when i could be making money
[10:35 PM] A Random Badger: and no she made no money off that advert cause it was like a volunteer competition type thing
[10:35 PM] A Random Badger: their wierd
[10:36 PM] A Random Badger: riot likes hosting them cause
[10:36 PM] A Random Badger: well just like with this advert
[10:36 PM] A Random Badger: how to explain
[10:36 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[10:37 PM] A Random Badger: well they get to make money off it
[10:37 PM] A Random Badger: lily doesnt, nor does any of the rest of community collaborators
[10:37 PM] A Random Badger: but if something good like that advert comes out of it
[10:37 PM] A Random Badger: riot gonna use it to make money for free
[10:37 PM] A Random Badger: and thats what happened with that
[10:38 PM] A Random Badger: so my argument is why would someone who didn't care about riot/league go to such a collaboration at riot headquarters when they could be doing something they did care about
[10:38 PM] A Random Badger: like making money
[10:38 PM] A Random Badger: streaming, making youtube videos etc
[10:40 PM] A Random Badger: you can say she just cares for league and went to the collab cause it was a league collab and thought it would be fun and it was the fun she cared about
[10:40 PM] A Random Badger: thats probably a better reasoning
[10:40 PM] A Random Badger: which is why i said i only loosely look down on her
[10:40 PM] A Random Badger: because of this possibility
[10:41 PM] A Random Badger: but as i said, she was still a predominant figure in the community back when i played and she did have connections to the esports scene and riot games and was definitely exposed to some of the said "morally grey areas"
[10:43 PM] A Random Badger: for example the huge exposure monte cristo did who was a huge esports figure for riot games and spoke out about the misconduct riot had towards the esports crew and the players
[10:43 PM] A Random Badger: along with thorin shields
[10:43 PM] A Random Badger: and several others
[10:44 PM] A Random Badger: yet most of this got brushed under the rug
[10:44 PM] A Random Badger: and people didn't care
[10:44 PM] A Random Badger: because like you said most of them only cared about the money
[10:44 PM] A Random Badger: they didn't care about the misconduct of riot games
[10:44 PM] A Random Badger: because as long as riot pays them who cares
[10:45 PM] A Random Badger: those are the people i look down on
[10:45 PM] A Random Badger: most of them im implying the professional streamers and other figures who knew about all of it and just ignored it all
[10:46 PM] A Random Badger: some of them were just plain ignorant or lazy
[10:46 PM] A Random Badger: i also look down on those people
[10:47 PM] A Random Badger: especially when these same people try to feed bullshit to the community that they're trying to make (insert w.e) better
[10:47 PM] A Random Badger: well no you're not
[10:48 PM] A Random Badger: because people who care about making blank better actively try to do such a thing
[10:48 PM] A Random Badger: i look down on a lot of things because they usually follow this exact trend
[10:49 PM] A Random Badger: and maybe its because i expect people to want to make blank better
[10:49 PM] A Random Badger: i dont see how that expectation is silly or wrong
[10:50 PM] A Random Badger: and a perfect example of this is even myself as you have pointed out
[10:50 PM] A Random Badger: i complain about the state of my life
[10:51 PM] A Random Badger: and yet in the past and still occasionally i refuse to want to make it better with action
[10:53 PM] A Random Badger: but you cant make progress without at least acknowledgment
[10:54 PM] A Random Badger: and the people who refuse to acknowledge a problem are the people i look down on most of all
[11:05 PM] fancy: idk
[11:05 PM] fancy: you'd have to ask her why she did it
[11:05 PM] fancy: for me personally idc what people do
[11:05 PM] A Random Badger: i guess its a flaw of mine just as much as it can be a virtue
[11:05 PM] fancy: because as long as riot pays them who cares
those are the people i look down on
[11:05 PM] fancy: this is like
[11:05 PM] A Random Badger: i have very strong opinions about people
[11:06 PM] fancy: everyone
[11:06 PM] fancy: so
[11:06 PM] fancy: yeah you have a lot of very strong opinions tbh
[11:06 PM] A Random Badger: if its something i feel comfortable about
[11:07 PM] A Random Badger: especially things revolving around morality
[11:07 PM] fancy: that's probably
[11:07 PM] fancy: unwise
[11:07 PM] fancy: tbh
[11:07 PM] A Random Badger: perhaps
[11:07 PM] A Random Badger: but its all centered around the idea of
[11:07 PM] A Random Badger: expecting people to want to make something better(edited)
[11:08 PM] fancy: except you don't even think that way
[11:08 PM] A Random Badger: you think so?
[11:08 PM] A Random Badger: example pls
[11:09 PM] A Random Badger: i think my largest uh
[11:09 PM] A Random Badger: uhhhh
[11:09 PM] A Random Badger: uhhhhhh
[11:09 PM] A Random Badger: you can fill in the blank
[11:09 PM] A Random Badger: is how i dont often wish to better my life
[11:10 PM] A Random Badger: but when it comes to other things i generally want to improve things
May 9, 2018
[12:19 AM] fancy: except you dont' really
[12:19 AM] fancy: you aren't actually that concerned with the general well being of the world in any way that I can see
[12:19 AM] fancy: you're just as concerned with your own personal satisfaction as anyone else
[12:19 AM] fancy: even though you're like
[12:19 AM] fancy: viewing everythign through this self-prescribed martyrdom complex
[12:19 AM] fancy: that's still at the end of teh day a selfish thing to do
[3:39 PM] fancy: what exactly does riot do that's so questionable
[3:39 PM] fancy: I don't really follow much
[3:40 PM] A Random Badger: I tell you after work
[3:40 PM] fancy: hurry
[3:40 PM] fancy: xd
[3:42 PM] A Random Badger: 20 minutes left
[3:42 PM] A Random Badger: Look up Monte cristo
[3:44 PM] fancy: that's a book
[3:56 PM] A Random Badger: Yes also a guy
[8:21 PM] A Random Badger: soz was an emergency
[8:21 PM] A Random Badger: a child got hurt
[8:21 PM] A Random Badger: and had to go to the hospital
[8:22 PM] A Random Badger: he was goofing off in the bathtub and hit his head real hard and gave himself a deep gash
[8:22 PM] A Random Badger: doc glued it up
[8:22 PM] A Random Badger: anyways uh let me link you a video or smth
[8:23 PM] A Random Badger: well here's his channel. choose some of your own videos, you can find them easily, he has quite a few
[8:23 PM] A Random Badger: monte cristo was a really smart and popular league of legends analyst and caster back when i played
[8:24 PM] A Random Badger: he's now an overwatch caster and analyst for blizzard
[8:24 PM] A Random Badger: monte has exposed a lot of the misconduct towards himself and others in the team during his time
[8:24 PM] A Random Badger: in terms of pay
[8:24 PM] A Random Badger: work effort
[8:24 PM] A Random Badger: benefits
[8:24 PM] A Random Badger: general treatment
[8:25 PM] A Random Badger: like treatment as a human
[8:25 PM] A Random Badger: idk
[8:25 PM] A Random Badger: how to say that
[8:25 PM] A Random Badger: anyways
[8:25 PM] A Random Badger: misconduct in the same regards towards pro players (another reason why they drop out so frequently)
[8:26 PM] A Random Badger: misconduct towards the viewers and their player base
[8:26 PM] A Random Badger: when it comes it playerbase i can't condemn it as so much of a misconduct but more of just a general toxic model for how they treat their game and their players
[8:26 PM] A Random Badger: so to speak
[8:27 PM] A Random Badger: their formal actions against specific figures within the community
[8:28 PM] A Random Badger: frequently the head director of riot games, merc merril aka tryndamere has verbally abused people in defense of certain actions taken by riot or general criticism about the game
[8:29 PM] A Random Badger: many other manger type figures within the scene also act this way
[8:29 PM] A Random Badger: ofc theres pendragon and all hsi toxicity
[8:29 PM] A Random Badger: what he did to the dota community
[8:29 PM] A Random Badger: tho this only added fuel to the fire for me personally, it wasn't like a deciding factor or anything an my stance on riot
[8:30 PM] A Random Badger: theres a lot of different things
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: the most severe ones being tryndamere's verballly ":abusive" statements and actions and the treatment of the esports crew
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: and all this was especially heated and up there when i left
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: it was a huge deciding factor for me to leave
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: cause you would see reddit posts nearly day after day of another toxic action riot had made
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: or something abusive merril did
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: the monte cristo stuff
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: he left shortly before i did
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: etc
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: lots
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: its uh
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: a loaded topic
[8:51 PM] fancy: hmm
[8:51 PM] fancy: I see
