[00:37 AM] A Random Badger: i think both teams are on equal playing fields because the game isn't built entirely around pvp, most things that you buy aren't for like taking on players more easily, its more of an advantage against the ai rather than a player
[00:37 AM] A Random Badger: that is
[00:37 AM] fancy: which makes the game easier
[00:37 AM] fancy: yes?
[00:37 AM] A Random Badger: no
[00:37 AM] A Random Badger: matter of fact
[00:37 AM] fancy: you just called it an advantage
[00:37 AM] fancy: so
[00:37 AM] A Random Badger: yes
[00:37 AM] A Random Badger: against the ai
[00:37 AM] fancy: ...
[00:37 AM] fancy: okay so
[00:38 AM] fancy: hold up
[00:38 AM] A Random Badger: but it doesnt make the game easier
[00:38 AM] fancy: do you agree that
[00:38 AM] A Random Badger: ill explain why
[00:38 AM] fancy: having an advantage agianst the ai
[00:38 AM] fancy: that another player doesn't have
[00:38 AM] fancy: is an advantage that you have that the other person does not
[00:38 AM] A Random Badger: yes but heres the thing theres this really neat balance that comes with that
[00:38 AM] A Random Badger: lets say this
[00:39 AM] A Random Badger: the team that is better equipped to take on the boss
[00:39 AM] A Random Badger: does so
[00:39 AM] A Random Badger: there strategy focuses entirely on finding and killing the boss
[00:39 AM] A Random Badger: which even with the best equipment takes time
[00:39 AM] A Random Badger: time for the other teams to catch up
[00:39 AM] A Random Badger: that isnt the only thing tho
[00:39 AM] A Random Badger: after you kill it
[00:40 AM] A Random Badger: you have to banish it before you can take your bounty and try to extract with it
[00:40 AM] A Random Badger: banishing it takes a very long amount of time
[00:40 AM] A Random Badger: forcing you into a defensive position
[00:40 AM] A Random Badger: while this basnishment is happening
[00:40 AM] A Random Badger: all other teams can see on the map
[00:41 AM] A Random Badger: where it is happening
[00:41 AM] fancy: yes
[00:41 AM] fancy: so far you still haven't shown how any of this invalidates the advantages
[00:41 AM] fancy: but go on
[00:41 AM] A Random Badger: so team A with the equipment advantage,
[00:42 AM] A Random Badger: no longer actually has an equipment advantage because in order to have killed the boss quickly as per their strategy, they will have exhausted their resources in the processes of the battle, this leaves them however
[00:42 AM] A Random Badger: with a defensive advantage
[00:42 AM] A Random Badger: at this point
[00:43 AM] A Random Badger: all other teams will most likely be on equal footing if not have a greater advantage in terms equipment because they have yet to spend theres fighting the boss
[00:43 AM] fancy: okay so I can pause you here
[00:43 AM] A Random Badger: sure
[00:43 AM] fancy: to bring this up
[00:43 AM] A Random Badger: but there is mroe so yanno
[00:43 AM] fancy: so several things
[00:43 AM] fancy: 1: at the point where the team that killed the boss
[00:43 AM] fancy: compare two hypotheticals
[00:44 AM] fancy: this team either A: started with full gear, max level hunters
[00:44 AM] fancy: or B: entry level hunters and no extra gear other than base
[00:44 AM] fancy: is scenario a going to have them in a stronger position post boss kill
[00:44 AM] fancy: than scenario b
[00:44 AM] fancy: aka more health, more possible remaining resources
[00:44 AM] fancy: etc
[00:45 AM] A Random Badger: yes
[00:45 AM] fancy: okay
[00:45 AM] fancy: then that's what I would call an out of game advantage
[00:45 AM] fancy: and now
[00:45 AM] fancy: 2:
[00:45 AM] fancy: considering the other teams that didnt' fight the boss
[00:45 AM] fancy: but stumbled upon the team that did
[00:45 AM] fancy: after they killed it
[00:45 AM] fancy: would this second team
[00:45 AM] fancy: compared again in hypotheticals
[00:46 AM] fancy: A: being max leveled, starting with all the gear options
[00:46 AM] fancy: vs B: being new recruits, etc
[00:46 AM] A Random Badger: this needs clarification i think
[00:46 AM] fancy: will scenario A have that second team, the "finding" team, in a better position to either take out the team that killed the boss or somehow steal the tokens or what have you, than in scenario B
NEW MESSAGES
[00:47 AM] A Random Badger: yes
