10:38 PM - A Random Badger: im soo
10:39 PM - A Random Badger: upset with my team
10:39 PM - A Random Badger: not upset
10:39 PM - A Random Badger: disappointed
10:39 PM - kami: I mean
10:39 PM - kami: have you seen my team
10:39 PM - kami: you don't udnerstand
10:39 PM - kami: wha ti've had to do
10:40 PM - A Random Badger: uh we had like a wood 1 viper
10:40 PM - A Random Badger: who never played before
10:40 PM - A Random Badger: apparently
10:40 PM - A Random Badger: at least didlo got farm
10:40 PM - kami: I have didlo and redman
10:40 PM - kami: we sucked didlo's dick so hard
10:40 PM - A Random Badger: yes but didlo doesnt have to do much
10:40 PM - A Random Badger: tbh
10:40 PM - kami: are u kidding
10:40 PM - kami: he has to do tons this game
10:40 PM - kami: this game was really really hard
10:41 PM - kami: u should listen to the vod and listen to what I had to do
10:41 PM - A Random Badger: i mean we had to do a shit ton to fight 4v5
10:41 PM - A Random Badger: tbh
10:41 PM - A Random Badger: i think thats the difference
10:41 PM - kami: not really I don't think
10:41 PM - kami: I think that the calls we made were just better more often than yours were better
10:41 PM - kami: it was really hard
10:41 PM - kami: but like that game is so easy to lose
10:41 PM - kami: for our team
10:41 PM - kami: it's such a hard game
10:42 PM - A Random Badger: sure but you have 2 experienced played who can shotcall
10:42 PM - A Random Badger: players*
10:42 PM - A Random Badger: we have like
10:42 PM - A Random Badger: mammoth
10:42 PM - A Random Badger: who didnt relaly actively shot call
10:42 PM - A Random Badger: it was mainly me
10:43 PM - A Random Badger: and like
10:43 PM - A Random Badger: tf do i know
10:43 PM - kami: I mean yeah
10:43 PM - kami: mammoth probably didn't know all that he needs to win that game
10:44 PM - kami: like if I'm talking objectively
10:44 PM - kami: because the moves you have to make that game aren't what you guys did really
10:46 PM - A Random Badger: tbh ig i dont even really care about the mistakes i think we did fine overall with what we did and what we had and there were good plays but regardless i think it was still a 4v5
10:46 PM - kami: yeah and half our heroes were half heroes lol
10:46 PM - kami: pizza was poor as shit
10:46 PM - kami: I had to use my hero in really jank ways
10:46 PM - A Random Badger: sure but you still has useful cores
10:47 PM - A Random Badger: and relaly good supports
10:47 PM - A Random Badger: we had to useful cores
10:47 PM - A Random Badger: and 2 good supports
10:47 PM - kami: useful is slightly generous for didlo
10:47 PM - kami: lol
10:47 PM - A Random Badger: we were missing a core nearly the entire game
10:47 PM - A Random Badger: i mean
10:47 PM - A Random Badger: fucking didlo was a pl
10:47 PM - kami: yeah and he fed
10:47 PM - A Random Badger: pl just kills all our mana
10:47 PM - kami: lol
10:47 PM - A Random Badger: and we can just do nothing
10:47 PM - kami: didn't u make no mana boots
10:47 PM - kami: on teh whole tea m
10:47 PM - kami: lol
10:47 PM - kami: or u made one
10:47 PM - kami: It hink
10:47 PM - A Random Badger: no
10:47 PM - A Random Badger: no
10:47 PM - A Random Badger: i thought a support did
10:47 PM - A Random Badger: i went
10:47 PM - A Random Badger: traqs
10:48 PM - kami: yeah
10:48 PM - kami: so
10:48 PM - kami: you need three
10:48 PM - kami: lol
10:48 PM - kami: against mana drains
10:48 PM - kami: or bkbs
10:48 PM - kami: void needed bkb
10:48 PM - kami: like
10:48 PM - kami: 5 years ago
10:48 PM - kami: you probably wanted to make a force staff
10:48 PM - kami: as well
10:48 PM - kami: i don't think the drum was good
10:48 PM - kami: also no spirit vessel
10:48 PM - kami: on your team
10:48 PM - A Random Badger: yea
10:48 PM - kami: spirit vessel op
10:48 PM - kami: really really good aginst kotl
10:48 PM - A Random Badger: shush 1 second
10:48 PM - A Random Badger: i called that out
10:49 PM - A Random Badger: and i got told
10:49 PM - A Random Badger: it was dumb
10:49 PM - kami: okay
10:49 PM - A Random Badger: the vessel
10:49 PM - kami: and then you say
10:49 PM - kami: no
10:49 PM - A Random Badger: and im like
10:49 PM - kami: it's not
10:49 PM - A Random Badger: okay
10:49 PM - kami: because it reduces healing
10:49 PM - kami: from kotl
10:49 PM - kami: and
10:49 PM - kami: it disables blinks
10:49 PM - A Random Badger: welp
10:49 PM - kami: and
10:49 PM - A Random Badger: they didnt want it
10:49 PM - kami: it can't be dispelled
10:49 PM - A Random Badger: apparently
10:49 PM - kami: by pl
10:49 PM - A Random Badger: i told mammoth to get it
10:49 PM - kami: I think
10:49 PM - A Random Badger: but nope
10:49 PM - kami: you should have just
10:49 PM - kami: made it
10:49 PM - kami: lol
10:49 PM - A Random Badger: i had so many items i wanted get
10:50 PM - A Random Badger: drums i wanted cause i wanted to end early cause i felt like fuckign late game would be a disaster for us
10:50 PM - kami: you have the better late game team I think
10:50 PM - A Random Badger: i think null was a must
10:50 PM - A Random Badger: i wanted aghs to just fucking
10:50 PM - A Random Badger: kill everyone
10:50 PM - kami: aghs isn't very good
10:50 PM - A Random Badger: cause fuck pl
10:50 PM - A Random Badger: i dont see how it isnt vs pl
10:50 PM - kami: it's not worth an item slot
10:50 PM - kami: you needed other things
10:51 PM - kami: like you need a spirit vessel
10:51 PM - kami: more than any other item in the game
10:51 PM - kami: going back for drum was pretty bad imo
10:51 PM - kami: it fucked your timings a lot
10:51 PM - kami: like if you want a drum
10:51 PM - kami: go urn drum
10:51 PM - A Random Badger: eh w.e
10:51 PM - kami: don't go blink drum
10:51 PM - A Random Badger: noited
10:51 PM - A Random Badger: noted
10:51 PM - A Random Badger: either way
10:51 PM - kami: cus they're two different item paths
10:51 PM - A Random Badger: fucking
10:52 PM - A Random Badger: matchmaking was bad
10:52 PM - kami: it was randomized lol what
10:52 PM - A Random Badger: "lets put pizza and fancy on a team together because statistically they do worse together"
10:52 PM - A Random Badger: like wat
10:52 PM - kami: they
10:52 PM - A Random Badger: i even said it aloud
10:52 PM - kami: randomized it
10:52 PM - A Random Badger: that
10:52 PM - kami: lol what
10:52 PM - kami: idk I didn't pay attention
10:52 PM - kami: but also they're bad at stats
10:52 PM - A Random Badger: that was just a statistical anomally
10:52 PM - kami: it's not really
10:53 PM - kami: it's just bad data is what it is
10:53 PM - A Random Badger: that anomally being thats the data didnt account for memes
10:53 PM - kami: because they don't consider the other factors
10:53 PM - A Random Badger: like fucking memes
10:53 PM - A Random Badger: but yes
10:53 PM - A Random Badger: it was an active decision
10:53 PM - A Random Badger: by redman mainly
10:53 PM - A Random Badger: and everyone wa slike
10:53 PM - A Random Badger: yea
10:53 PM - A Random Badger: and im like
10:53 PM - A Random Badger: ?_?
10:53 PM - A Random Badger: no
10:53 PM - kami: and all your players are better than our players except for me and pizza
10:53 PM - A Random Badger: and then we had like
10:53 PM - kami: and ur one bad player
10:54 PM - A Random Badger: a league of legends player who never play dota before
10:54 PM - A Random Badger: aparently
10:54 PM - A Random Badger: so it was 4v5 where 2 of the 5 were good players and 1 of our 4 was a good player
10:54 PM - A Random Badger: arguably
10:54 PM - kami: grunee is better than didlo
10:54 PM - kami: you're better than redman
10:54 PM - kami: mammoth is better than taro
10:55 PM - kami: the viper pick was bad
10:55 PM - A Random Badger: i think thats still highly inaccurate considering we still had a viper who was useless and only knew how to play viper
10:55 PM - A Random Badger: regardless of 3 of your 5 being abd players
10:55 PM - A Random Badger: at least they knew what dota is
10:55 PM - A Random Badger: we had someone who thought he was playing fucking
10:55 PM - A Random Badger: chechers
10:56 PM - A Random Badger: or something
10:56 PM - A Random Badger: checkers*
10:56 PM - kami: the biggest problemw as ur void
10:56 PM - kami: didn't make bkb until 52 minutes
10:56 PM - kami: more than ur viper
10:56 PM - kami: like
10:56 PM - kami: no matter how good that viper is he never does anything this game
10:56 PM - kami: ur team was super not mobile
10:56 PM - A Random Badger: i mean i can only see that arguement if you're trying to say "your statistical likelihood of winning a 4v5 is greater if your void is better"
10:57 PM - A Random Badger: even if viper is bad
10:57 PM - A Random Badger: he can like
10:57 PM - A Random Badger: right click things
10:57 PM - A Random Badger: he couldnt even do that
10:57 PM - kami: you p[robably still lose fights
10:57 PM - kami: if void has no bkb
10:57 PM - kami: if your viper is 8k
10:57 PM - A Random Badger: i mean
10:58 PM - A Random Badger: thats inaccurate considering we slaughtered you in some fights without bkb
10:58 PM - A Random Badger: if i remember correctly
10:58 PM - kami: but you can't end games
10:58 PM - kami: without a bkb
10:58 PM - kami: also using chrono to pick me
10:58 PM - kami: is basically never worth this game
10:58 PM - kami: because you need it to fight
10:59 PM - A Random Badger: noted
10:59 PM - A Random Badger: w.e
10:59 PM - A Random Badger: i go do something else
10:59 PM - A Random Badger: i wish i didnt trap myself into that
10:59 PM - kami: I mean it was a good game for everyone involved lol
10:59 PM - kami: pretty even
10:59 PM - kami: for this skill bracket
10:59 PM - A Random Badger: it was enjoyable sure
10:59 PM - A Random Badger: but it was also
10:59 PM - A Random Badger: very frustrating
10:59 PM - A Random Badger: for me
11:00 PM - A Random Badger: especially considering how long it was
11:00 PM - kami: you're telling me
11:00 PM - kami: lol
11:00 PM - A Random Badger: making it even more disappointing
11:00 PM - A Random Badger: uh
11:00 PM - A Random Badger: you get the win satisfaction tho
11:00 PM - kami: yeah
11:00 PM - kami: and it was also didlo memes
11:00 PM - kami: and redman memes
11:00 PM - kami: really frustrating
11:00 PM - A Random Badger: AND WE HAD 5 PEOPLE PLAYING SERIOUSLY
11:00 PM - A Random Badger: WHO COULDNT DO SHIT
11:00 PM - A Random Badger: LIEK
11:00 PM - A Random Badger: WAT
11:00 PM - kami: that's less frustrating
11:00 PM - kami: than morons
11:01 PM - kami: lol
11:01 PM - kami: your team made bad calls like that's all I can say
11:01 PM - kami: we made bad calls too soemtimes
11:01 PM - kami: I got reverse super baited like three times
11:02 PM - kami: we blocked like half our own hooks too
11:03 PM - A Random Badger: i still disagree, as far as what the primary cause of it was, i still think it was havign a useless fucking viper because even a viper with items that we can 5v5 with who cna at least right click people, is 20% better than only having 4 slightly reliable people being useful vs people who, even tho they're fucking memeing, are useful and can get away with fucking memeing like it was some kind of fucking handicap joke
11:03 PM - A Random Badger: that part also made it highly disappointed and frustrating
11:04 PM - kami: you can disagree but it's also pretty factually wrong that the viper was ever going to do anything this game
11:04 PM - kami: he's way too immobile
11:04 PM - kami: his hero is shit aginst tinker and agianst pl
11:04 PM - kami: and against torm
11:04 PM - kami: he's only semi good against clock
11:04 PM - kami: viper doesn't get to play this game
11:04 PM - A Random Badger: but its still dmg he could be doing
11:04 PM - kami: not really
11:04 PM - kami: he doesn't hit people
11:04 PM - kami: in this game
11:04 PM - kami: lol
11:05 PM - kami: he gets swarmed with illusions or lasered
11:05 PM - kami: and dies
11:05 PM - kami: because his lane is gonna be shit cus he can't lane against lasers
11:05 PM - kami: like this is such a bad viper game
11:05 PM - kami: but void buying a bkb instead of an mkb lets him do whatever the rfuck he wants
11:05 PM - kami: like we never kill a bkb void
11:05 PM - kami: ever
