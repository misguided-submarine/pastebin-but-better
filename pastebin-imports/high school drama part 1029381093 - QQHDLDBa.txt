[11:11 PM] Von Tugen: So it seems Althaia wanted to make her own fc and Jiesus, Argo, Mango, and Adenan went with her.  IDK if anyone else is leaving, but those are the ones so far.
[11:13 PM] shin (hi): ya
[11:13 PM] shin (hi): very sudden
[11:15 PM] Von Tugen: she bought one apparently
[11:15 PM] shin (hi): do we have any idea why
[11:15 PM] shin (hi): mango has no idea lol
[11:16 PM] Von Tugen: what do you mean
[11:16 PM] shin (hi): like why they wanted to make their own
[11:17 PM] shin (hi): i asked mango and she said she was just following her friends lol
[11:17 PM] shin (hi): but she doesn't know why they left in the first place
[11:17 PM] Von Tugen: Althaia wanted her own and jiesus and argo went with her, adenan went cause of jie and argo
[11:17 PM] shin (hi): ah
[11:17 PM] Von Tugen: i didnt think mango would go with them
[11:17 PM] Von Tugen: but i guess so
[11:18 PM] shin (hi): weird
[11:19 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Well Jiesus was getting more and more upset about us not catering to his snowflake-ness xD
[11:20 PM] shin (hi): yeah that one I kinda could expect
[11:20 PM] Von Tugen: well him althaia and argo are pretty much a package
[11:21 PM] Von Tugen: some more people are definitely gonna leave so expect that idk who though
[11:22 PM] Von Tugen: they asked me  if i was interested a little earlier today, i didnt know they were doing it tonight though
[11:23 PM] Jade (Vysis): Doesnt really matter. If they'd rather split the FC to have their own then nothing we can do about it
[11:23 PM] shin (hi): ya it's mostly just a curiosity
[11:23 PM] shin (hi): for me at least
[11:23 PM] Jade (Vysis): I have 0 clue
[11:23 PM] shin (hi): but I'm also 100000% lazy so I'd never make my own FC
[11:24 PM] shin (hi): if I had to leave I'd just have no FC XD
[11:24 PM] Jade (Vysis): No one said anything about being unhappy with the FC and most of them acted as if they loved this one so idk
[11:24 PM] Von Tugen: i dont think it was being unhappy with the fc
[11:24 PM] Von Tugen: they just wanted
[11:24 PM] Von Tugen: their circle
[11:24 PM] Von Tugen: as the fc
[11:24 PM] Frozen: oh so that's what happened lol kinda sucks that none of them really said anything when they left
[11:24 PM] Frozen: except alt
[11:24 PM] Jade (Vysis): Then I hope they're happy
[11:25 PM] Von Tugen: idk tho
[11:25 PM] Von Tugen: im just guessing
[11:25 PM] Von Tugen: cause they asked me if id be interested in a smaller fc
[11:25 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Jie was obviously unhappy and he probably shit talked us to them, making them unhappy. He tells them everything
[11:25 PM] shin (hi): yeah at least the original 3 probably
[11:26 PM] Von Tugen: seems althaia is the one recruiting people though
[11:26 PM] Frozen: was it because of the savage raid thing or were there other things
[11:26 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Probably the savage raid thing
[11:26 PM] Jade (Vysis): As in she's trying to take more members?
[11:27 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I'm messaging Jie and telling him they need to stop trying to poach
[11:28 PM] Von Tugen: i mean from what they said i think there are others who may not be on now who are joining them
[11:28 PM] Von Tugen: i think they were trying to recruit their friends
[11:28 PM] Von Tugen: not take as many as they could or w.e
[11:28 PM] Frozen: yea its probably whoever they're closest to
[11:30 PM] Von Tugen: ramu i would guess but i dont know for certain
[11:30 PM] Jade (Vysis): It doesnt really matter who. If people want to leave that's fine
[11:30 PM] Von Tugen: no, throw them in the dungeon
[11:31 PM] Jade (Vysis): Lol
[11:31 PM] Jade (Vysis): This is making me sad enough
[11:31 PM] Jade (Vysis): Thought we were all friends and kinda hurt they just left
[11:31 PM] Jade (Vysis): So dont really feel like throwing any in a dungeon
[11:31 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Tell Jie that you hurt his deelings xD
[11:32 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): feelings*
[11:32 PM] Deo Luminai: I mean if they just left and are trying to poach members. Remove them from this server so they can't message via Discord
[11:32 PM] Jade (Vysis): I hurt his feelings?
[11:32 PM] Deo Luminai: and also do an announcement about it
[11:32 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): He hurt yours*
[11:32 PM] Jade (Vysis): I don't think an announcement is a good idea
[11:32 PM] Von Tugen: honestly if anyone doesnt wanna be in the fc
[11:32 PM] Jade (Vysis): We dont need to make a spectacle out of kt
[11:32 PM] Von Tugen: let em go
[11:32 PM] Von Tugen: is best for everyone
[11:32 PM] Deo Luminai: No but when people find out they will think something happened. Like we did
[11:32 PM] Von Tugen: that way
[11:32 PM] Jade (Vysis): What Von said
[11:32 PM] Deo Luminai: So they will ask
[11:33 PM] Von Tugen: i mean
[11:33 PM] Von Tugen: its not like
[11:33 PM] Deo Luminai: And it's better for us to be in charge of the narrative than them ;p
[11:33 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): We can make an announcement and make them look bad if we really wanted to :p
[11:33 PM] Von Tugen: i wouldnt tho
[11:33 PM] Jade (Vysis): We shouldn't make them look bad. That makes us look bad
[11:33 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I know lol
[11:34 PM] Von Tugen: honestly their pitch to me wasnt anything negative about the fc at all, not a single thing, just ur friends with us and we want to make an fc for just our friends
[11:34 PM] Deo Luminai: Yea, maybe something like They left to make their own FC, no bad blood. All still friends. Happy smiles unicorns
[11:34 PM] Von Tugen: that was bout it
[11:34 PM] Frozen: i dunno if ramu will leave he was on when they all left
[11:34 PM] Von Tugen: ah ok
[11:34 PM] Von Tugen: he seemed tight with mango
[11:35 PM] Von Tugen: was just speculatin
[11:35 PM] Raithe: Wait, Jeisus left?
[11:35 PM] Von Tugen: indeed
[11:35 PM] Deo Luminai: Honestly, we have no issue with recruiting or maintaining the FC. So they are all replaceable
[11:35 PM] Frozen: they were all doing memoria miseria ex when it happened lol
[11:35 PM] Raithe: Sweet, I should start playing again then
[11:35 PM] Von Tugen: i mean most of the active people in the fc arent the active people from 2 months ago
[11:35 PM] Deo Luminai: Von can't leave though. He is basically our mascot
[11:36 PM] Von Tugen: new people will join
[11:36 PM] Von Tugen: new people will become active members
[11:37 PM] Von Tugen: aurk gonna be in shout chat adding new members like[11:38 PM] Von Tugen: damn your quality is much better
[11:38 PM] Raithe: Is tarot card simba or the monkey?
[11:39 PM] Deo Luminai: He is rafiki
[11:39 PM] Deo Luminai: The FC is Simba
[11:41 PM] Jade (Vysis): Yes we will still find more, but feels like we lost people who were core members
[11:42 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): To be fair, they only played with each other pretty much xD
[11:42 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): None of them interacted with anyone else in the FC much anymore except the odd answer to a question
[11:42 PM] shin (hi): At least now Jie can't complain about us not helping with savage
[11:42 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): xD
[11:42 PM] shin (hi): low key pissed me off
[11:42 PM] shin (hi): so much
[11:43 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): If you look in #warnings-and-bans-log we keep track of stuff. I was actually 99% of the way to giving Jie a warning for what he was saying
[11:43 PM] Deo Luminai: Yea didn't Alth got several weeks/month without playing?
[11:43 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Yeah
[11:44 PM] Von Tugen: she pretty much came back like a week ago
[11:44 PM] Von Tugen: she was gone awhile
[11:44 PM] Deo Luminai: Yea xD So just wait till she gets bored again and quits
[11:45 PM] Raithe: I can't really say anything to that
[11:45 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): So with Jie gone, Raithe and Deo will be active daily
[11:45 PM] Raithe: I'll play when we have a new raid tier cominng

[11:45 PM] Raithe: Yea, I hated Jie
[11:45 PM] Deo Luminai: And they were core members in only that they were on a lot. They only did stuff with each other and outside of being active, they did next to nothing for the FC. Byeong and Von have been the most active when it comes to FC events
[11:46 PM] shin (hi): i just work here
[11:46 PM] Frozen: why wait for new raid tier when you can be like shin
[11:46 PM] Frozen: and just raid forever
[11:46 PM] Raithe: It's all because of Deo that I didn't make his life hell
[11:46 PM] Jade (Vysis): No
[11:46 PM] shin (hi): No one wants to be shin
[11:46 PM] Jade (Vysis): Shin is crazy
[11:46 PM] Von Tugen: or
[11:46 PM] Deo Luminai: SHin is too creepy for me
[11:46 PM] shin (hi): wtf
[11:46 PM] shin (hi): creepy
[11:46 PM] Von Tugen: shin
[11:46 PM] shin (hi): that's a new one
[11:46 PM] Von Tugen: did u finish ur fishing
[11:46 PM] Jade (Vysis): Those mafia ties?
[11:47 PM] Deo Luminai: I mean...when you first joined the raid team a year ago you said you wished Ysthola would sit on your face
[11:47 PM] Deo Luminai: So 100% creepy
[11:47 PM] shin (hi): you are projecting
[11:47 PM] shin (hi): i am sure
[11:47 PM] Deo Luminai: You a creep
[11:47 PM] shin (hi): that doesn't even sound like something I would say
[11:47 PM] Deo Luminai:
[11:47 PM] Von Tugen: idk who to believe
[11:48 PM] shin (hi): also no I'm halfway Von
[11:48 PM] shin (hi): I hate it so much
[11:49 PM] Raithe: I would believe Deo, he never forgets anything. When I am the imposter in Among Us he's the only one that remembers where everyone was.
[11:49 PM] Von Tugen: im doing triple triad cards now shin, ive gone from 30 to 200 this week its as bad as diadem
[11:49 PM] Jade (Vysis): Why are you both into grinding your soul away?
[11:49 PM] Von Tugen: this is what I do
[11:49 PM] Von Tugen: i do not exist without dumb grinds
[11:49 PM] shin (hi): Von is my kindred spirit in this
[11:50 PM] Jade (Vysis): Someone make more art of Von but with triple triad cards pls
[11:50 PM] shin (hi): astro cosplay?
[11:50 PM] Deo Luminai:
[11:50 PM] Deo Luminai: There
[11:50 PM] shin (hi): i love memes I don't recognize
[11:54 PM] Jade (Vysis): There goes Ramu
[11:54 PM] Von Tugen: oh yep there it is
[11:54 PM] Von Tugen: im just surprised none of them said anything
[11:54 PM] Von Tugen: just like ninjad out
[11:55 PM] shin (hi): liek 2 of them said something in FC chat but it was like super vague lol
[11:55 PM] Jade (Vysis): Probably didnt want a confrontation. I wouldn't have known what to say if they did anyway
[11:57 PM] Von Tugen: im just curious where they got the gil
[11:57 PM] Von Tugen: thats the real mystery
[11:57 PM] Von Tugen: lol
[11:58 PM] shin (hi): how much do fc's cost
[11:58 PM] shin (hi): I imagine quite a bit?
[11:58 PM] Jade (Vysis): However much the GM sells it for
[11:58 PM] shin (hi): ty jade
[11:58 PM] Jade (Vysis): You're welcome
[11:58 PM] shin (hi): i am enlightened now
[11:58 PM] shin (hi): :02smile0:
[11:58 PM] Von Tugen: with a medium house and subs and airships and stuff which it apparently had
[11:58 PM] Von Tugen: prob like 100m
[11:58 PM] shin (hi): wtf
[11:59 PM] Jade (Vysis): None of them had that not even pooled together
[11:59 PM] Von Tugen: which is odd cause they all usually had like a few million
[11:59 PM] shin (hi): even if mango yoinked all the money I gave her to decorate my house rofl
[11:59 PM] shin (hi): not even close
[11:59 PM] Von Tugen: thats why i said its a mystery lol
[1:00 AM] Von Tugen: ye
[1:00 AM] Byeong Ha: And I really, really hope jiesus understands that leaving us leaves him -10% to find a group to savage raid :joy:
[1:00 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): You gonna divorce him now?
[1:00 AM] Byeong Ha: I honestly
[1:00 AM] Byeong Ha: It crossed my mind
[1:00 AM] Byeong Ha: :joy::joy:
[1:00 AM] Von Tugen: o

[1:00 AM] Von Tugen: i forgot that was a thing '
[1:01 AM] Von Tugen: shit
[1:01 AM] Byeong Ha: Do we keep the mount ?
[1:01 AM] shin (hi): yeah
[1:01 AM] Byeong Ha: Oh
[1:01 AM] Frozen: i actually thought byeong would know more about the situation since they're married in game
[1:01 AM] Byeong Ha: Cy@ then
[1:01 AM] shin (hi): you keep the mount and the emote I think
[1:01 AM] Frozen: lol
[1:01 AM] Byeong Ha: I mean I was working so idk haven’t really been on today
[1:02 AM] Byeong Ha: I hope anyways it wasn’t he’s only goal, cuz with the new 5.4 hitting we’ll all be going into savages 24/7
[1:02 AM] Byeong Ha: So gl to them to raid cuz those who left are not raiding materials :man_shrugging_tone1:
[1:04 AM] Von Tugen: ya idk
[1:04 AM] shin (hi): yeah especially if he's gonna like not do PF
[1:05 AM] shin (hi): he complained about PF so much after like... 2 days of doing it >_>
[1:05 AM] Von Tugen: shin needs the bane meme
[1:05 AM] shin (hi): the who what
[1:06 AM] Von Tugen: you merely adopted the party finder, i was born in it, molded by it
[1:07 AM] Von Tugen: batman movies
[1:07 AM] Frozen: i thought you were born in diadem
[1:07 AM] Von Tugen: i was
[1:07 AM] Von Tugen: i was doing shin
[1:07 AM] shin (hi): ya
[1:08 AM] shin (hi): like idk how u do PF for two days and then get all "i'm so over PF"
[1:08 AM] shin (hi): like screw off I spent 90 hours doing shiva over two weeks to get my first clear
[1:08 AM] shin (hi): I think ramu was decent though
[1:10 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): He was parsing less than me on my PLD
[1:10 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): and the other PLD
[1:12 AM] Frozen: tbh i just expect to not clear when I join pf parties
[1:12 AM] Frozen: makes me pleasantly surprised when we do clear
[1:19 AM] Frozen: @SwarlesBarkley (Aurk) just checking, you were putting together raid teams for 5.4 right? I remember you asked for people who were interested before
[1:20 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Most of those that were interested left today lol. But the other team within the FC that's on break right now has spots
[1:26 AM] Frozen: mostly asking since caol is considering leaving with them lol but he also wants to raid 5.4 so hes a bit torn
[1:26 AM] shin (hi): lol
[1:27 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): lmao
[1:27 AM] shin (hi): if they all leave do they realize I won't be there to help them anymore
[1:27 AM] shin (hi): XD
[1:27 AM] shin (hi): oh also
[1:27 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): WE WANNA RAID! SO LET'S LEAVE THE FC THAT GIVES US OUR ONLY CHANCE
[1:27 AM] shin (hi): don't forget to remove from the officer linkshell btw
[1:28 AM] Frozen: yea i dont really understand they left to socialize with each other but they already do that
[1:28 AM] Frozen: i guess socialize more privately
[1:28 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): right
[1:28 AM] shin (hi): i don't understand the point of a small fc
[1:28 AM] Frozen: but thats what linkshells are for
[1:28 AM] shin (hi): at that point it's just a linkshell
[1:28 AM] shin (hi): yeah
[1:32 AM] Byeong Ha: they really coulda just made a linkshell for them lmao
[1:33 AM] Frozen: im sure they already had a linkshell honestly
[1:33 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Probably where they discussed leaving lol
[7:49 AM] Jade (Vysis): Is everyone still in favor of making an announcement so others dont freak out or do we think that's unnecessary?
[8:09 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): If you make an announcement, run it by me first
[8:10 AM] Jade (Vysis): I can't make one until I get home anyway
[12:39 AM] Von Tugen: Caol and Vanzir went to join the others
[12:39 AM] Frozen: honestly not surprised, was more surprised they stayed a bit lol
[12:39 AM] Von Tugen: not surprised by either
[12:39 AM] Von Tugen: ya
[12:39 AM] Von Tugen: i was surprised when i saw vanzir log in i just kinda assumed he left
[12:40 AM] Frozen: apparently, they've had some bad experiences with some people in the fc though? i didn't want to pry though
[12:40 AM] Frozen: so idk much
[12:40 AM] Frozen: but thats part of the reason they left it seems
[12:57 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Bad experiences? Alright then lmao
[1:02 AM] Frozen: yea "bad run ins" is how he worded it
[1:07 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Bad run ins means Jie told them we treated him poorly xD
[1:08 AM] Frozen: i was kinda thinking that might be it
[1:17 AM] Byeong Ha: Amarina dmed me to know if I left the fc too ahaha she said she’d kick my butt if I did
[1:17 AM] Byeong Ha: So I guess even an outsider doesn’t even understand their reason :joy:
[7:42 PM] shin (hi): lol the guys that left are complaining that they got removed from this discord
[7:42 PM] shin (hi): ??????
[7:42 PM] shin (hi): my brain melts
[7:43 PM] Jade (Vysis): oh they whispered you too?
[7:44 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Lmao

[7:47 PM] shin (hi): it's like high school all over again I love it
[7:47 PM] Jade (Vysis): i dont understand, why would they want to stay in discord if they dont want to be in the FC
[7:47 PM] shin (hi): "I was gonna say goodbye but instead I just left but I swear I was gonna say it eventually"
[7:47 PM] shin (hi): my sides
[7:47 PM] Jade (Vysis): also I dont stream anymore, the only reason to be subbed to me is cause they forgot to cancel
[7:48 PM] shin (hi): I didn't even know you retired
[7:48 PM] Jade (Vysis): yeah I wanted to focus more on other hobbies and the FC
[7:48 PM] shin (hi): I wish I had hobbies
[7:48 PM] shin (hi): I respect it
[7:49 PM] shin (hi): idk how they think there's bad blood but whatever
[7:49 PM] shin (hi): unless there's something I don't know about
[7:49 PM] Jade (Vysis): I have no idea
[7:50 PM] shin (hi): but you can't fix everyone's stupid opinions anyway so
[7:50 PM] shin (hi): people gonna think what they wanna think
[7:50 PM] Jade (Vysis): but if they dont care about saying anything before just lkeaving i dont know why they carte about being in the discord
[7:50 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): So much bad blood
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/733091864202444800/771521412976476190/unknown.png
[7:50 PM] shin (hi): Yeah I don't get it
[7:51 PM] Jade (Vysis): we regularly clean the discord of people who join pug raids, its just something we do
[7:51 PM] shin (hi): "I left the discord that is specifically for the FC cus I'm not in the FC how come?????"
[7:51 PM] shin (hi): :bcaCryingFunny2:
[7:51 PM] shin (hi): that does not look as much like it is laughing as I had thought it would

[7:52 PM] shin (hi): lol??????
[7:52 PM] Jade (Vysis): wring his neck for what?
[7:53 PM] Jade (Vysis): keeping our FC discord for our FC?
[7:53 PM] shin (hi): you have as much context as I do
[7:53 PM] shin (hi): I need popcorn
[7:53 PM] shin (hi): :LKanimPopcorn:
[7:53 PM] shin (hi): does he think this is a sub discord too
[7:53 PM] shin (hi): for retired streamer
[7:53 PM] shin (hi): has everyone lost their mind
[7:54 PM] shin (hi): covid must be getting to them
[7:54 PM] Jade (Vysis): this hasnt been a discord for my streams in a long time lol
[7:54 PM] Jade (Vysis): the FC literally took over my time and discord
[7:54 PM] shin (hi): ya
[7:54 PM] shin (hi): it exploded out of nowhere tbh
[7:55 PM] shin (hi): like one day you and aurk were asking me to join your fc and you had like 8 people and the next thing I know I look and it's like hundreds of members
[7:55 PM] Jade (Vysis): yes
[7:56 PM] Jade (Vysis): and equally out of nowhere they wanted an FC for just their friends soooo why does this discord even matter to them
[7:56 PM] shin (hi): they're making plans to recruit people too
[7:56 PM] shin (hi): so that's also BS
[7:56 PM] Jade (Vysis): oh yeah i know
[7:56 PM] shin (hi): I feel like a double agent
[7:56 PM] Jade (Vysis): you're only a double agent if you're giving them info too
[7:57 PM] shin (hi): oo
[7:57 PM] shin (hi): is that how that works
[7:57 PM] Jade (Vysis): yes
[7:57 PM] shin (hi): so I'm just a single agent
[7:57 PM] shin (hi): I see
[7:57 PM] Jade (Vysis): single and ready to mingle
[7:57 PM] shin (hi): the only thing I told them is that as far as I know no one hates them lol
[7:57 PM] shin (hi): ew never
[7:58 PM] Jade (Vysis): im pretty sure know one hates them
[7:58 PM] Jade (Vysis): i at least was sad that they all left...without saying anything to us
[7:58 PM] Jade (Vysis): soooooooooo
[7:58 PM] shin (hi): yeah
[7:58 PM] shin (hi): I said that to some of them
[7:58 PM] shin (hi): and they were like
[7:58 PM] shin (hi): "but we weren't even close with her"
[7:58 PM] shin (hi): ????
[7:58 PM] shin (hi): lol
[7:59 PM] Jade (Vysis): then they shouldnt care that they're not in my discord:upside_down:
[7:59 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): So let me get this straight
[7:59 PM] shin (hi): this is like a sitcom
[7:59 PM] shin (hi): who even needs cable
[7:59 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): They're mad that they were kicked from the Discord but they are like "Yeah, we didn't even like them"
[8:00 PM] shin (hi): "I'm sad I didn't get to say a proper goodbye" and also "idk I wasn't very close with aurk/jade anyway"
[8:00 PM] shin (hi): both are more or less direct quotes I've heard from multiple of them lol
[8:00 PM] Jade (Vysis): shrugs
[8:01 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I'm waiting for Cosmos to wring out my neck
[8:01 PM] shin (hi): I personally find this very hilarious
[8:01 PM] shin (hi): it's like
[8:01 PM] shin (hi): how to manufacture drama that doesn't exist 101
[8:01 PM] shin (hi): XD
[8:02 PM] Jade (Vysis): idk, thats their problem
[8:03 PM] shin (hi): ya it's funny to watch
[8:03 PM] Jade (Vysis): also its funny if Jie was one of the oones who said he wasnt close to me considering he borrowed money from me when he was in trouble
[8:03 PM] Jade (Vysis): real money
[8:03 PM] shin (hi): knowing that no one here is on the same page as them at all lol
[8:03 PM] shin (hi): and nah Jie hasn't said much yet in discord
[8:04 PM] shin (hi): other than joining for like 5 pulls of e7s before giving up again
[8:04 PM] shin (hi): :002shrug:
[8:04 PM] Jade (Vysis): we also all pitched in to help Althia get a house....all of us
[8:04 PM] Jade (Vysis): so i dont know where any of this "we hate them" is coming from
[8:05 PM] shin (hi): there is a post explicitly banning talking about "shit going on in Wipe" while also simultaneously saying they don't want to create any drama
[8:05 PM] shin (hi): apparently we have a lot of shit going on
[8:05 PM] Jade (Vysis): we do?
[8:05 PM] shin (hi): like how all my shards and crystals were stolen
[8:05 PM] shin (hi): and someone clearly rigged the drops
[8:05 PM] shin (hi): so I only got gil
[8:05 PM] shin (hi): :GengarRAGEe:
[8:07 PM] shin (hi): ooo
[8:07 PM] shin (hi): Aurk he got you

[8:08 PM] shin (hi): I have a new favourite quote
[8:08 PM] shin (hi): "Saying I'd be welcome if I wanted to rejoin isn't very welcoming"
[8:09 PM] shin (hi): :laughing~1:
[8:09 PM] shin (hi): I can't even
[8:09 PM] shin (hi): is this real life
[8:09 PM] shin (hi): also did we get perks for being subbed to you other than being purple?
[8:09 PM] Jade (Vysis): no
[8:09 PM] shin (hi): LOL
[8:09 PM] Jade (Vysis): those perk channels were deleted long ago
[8:09 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk):

[8:10 PM] shin (hi): Also if they want to keep up with people
[8:10 PM] shin (hi): I hear discord has this really neat feature
[8:10 PM] shin (hi): where u can add people to your friends list
[8:10 PM] shin (hi): and then message them directly
[8:10 PM] shin (hi): maybe it's just new and they haven't heard about it yet
[8:11 PM] shin (hi): :02smile0:
[8:11 PM] shin (hi): omg the response "sorry you have to deal with that"
[8:11 PM] shin (hi): I'm legit dying laughing this is amazing
[8:12 PM] shin (hi): omg
[8:12 PM] shin (hi): IT JUST GETS BETTER
[8:12 PM] shin (hi):

[8:12 PM] shin (hi): LMAO?
[8:13 PM] shin (hi): he's so mad
[8:13 PM] Jade (Vysis): yeah sorry you had to deal with that..........

[8:13 PM] Jade (Vysis): deal with what
[8:13 PM] shin (hi): I really wish
[8:13 PM] shin (hi): I had enough free time
[8:13 PM] shin (hi): and energy
[8:13 PM] shin (hi): that I can spend it on getting this mad over stuff that matters so little
[8:14 PM] shin (hi): Instead I have to use my free time for important things like buying food or cleaning
[8:16 PM] Jade (Vysis): i mean, thats where a lot of my free time goes. No one wants to clean for me :frowning:
[8:16 PM] shin (hi): cleaning sucks
[8:17 PM] shin (hi): Have they invented something that keeps dust from happening yet
[8:17 PM] shin (hi): I need that
[8:17 PM] shin (hi): lol
[8:18 PM] shin (hi): his interpretation of aurk's response is that aurk was saying "it's their fault"
[8:18 PM] Jade (Vysis): i dont even care anymore. They have now gone out of their way to be mad about them leaving
[8:19 PM] shin (hi): I'm not sure if it's sad or just funny at this point
[8:20 PM] Jade (Vysis): its sad just really sad. I would just like to forget it and move on
[8:22 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk):
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/733091864202444800/771529535719079946/unknown.png
[8:28 PM] Frozen: I can’t believe they’re whining about being kicked from a discord server for a fc they quit wew
[8:28 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Lmao
[8:28 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I can't believe the guy with anger problems (me) is giving calm responses lmao
[8:30 PM] Frozen: also if they wanted to say goodbye they could have said it in the discord before leaving ??
[8:30 PM] Jade (Vysis): or in the game before disappearing out of nowhere
[8:31 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I also didn't remove anyone within 2 hours of them leaving. Were they typing for 2 hours then got kicked?
[8:32 PM] Jade (Vysis): I just am more confused than when they left. I dont know why they did, I dont know why they have a problem with us, This entire situation just came out of nowhere
[8:38 PM] Deo Luminai: I mean...if he was going to keep up with some people...he shouldn't have left without saying anything xD
[8:40 PM] Frozen: the only thing I could think of is jie bringing up savage raiding to officers unless you guys have interacted with them at some other time
[8:45 PM] Byeong Ha: honestly those ppl are messed up
[8:45 PM] Byeong Ha: they live for RP and get mad when other ppl dont live their fantasy
[8:46 PM] Byeong Ha: literal brain dead
[8:50 PM] Frozen: dont think they're all bad, some of them probably have been shit talking to convince people to join lol
[8:51 PM] Von Tugen: uh i missed a lot
[8:51 PM] Von Tugen: in i go
[8:51 PM] Von Tugen: wish me luck
[8:51 PM] Von Tugen: time to read
[8:53 PM] Jade (Vysis): nope, havent interacted with them about anything else
[8:55 PM] Von Tugen: i shoulda joined that discord when they invited me
[8:56 PM] Von Tugen: just to :eyes:
[8:57 PM] Von Tugen: anything that says no drama is always drama
[8:57 PM] Byeong Ha: xd u shoulda von
[9:02 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Shin, i want more screenshots if anything happens xD
[9:02 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): This fuels me
[9:04 PM] shin (hi): :MenheraPopcorn:
[9:05 PM] Raithe: This is just awesome
[9:12 PM] Raithe: Is there anymore on this yet?
[9:17 PM] shin (hi):
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/733091864202444800/771543303338328064/Screenshot_20201029-211731.png
[9:17 PM] shin (hi): they made a channel
[9:22 PM] Raithe: They are really into that whole subscriber thing xD
[9:22 PM] Deo Luminai: Keep sharing, shin
[9:23 PM] Jade (Vysis): didnt realize being my subscriber was such a comoddity
[9:23 PM] Raithe: me neither
[9:23 PM] Von Tugen: why dont we all go around and share how we feel
[9:23 PM] Deo Luminai: I feel like this situation deserves to be a daytime soap
[9:23 PM] Deo Luminai: and I'm loving every second of it
[9:24 PM] Von Tugen: haha
[9:25 PM] Raithe: I feel like I should have been informed about the subscriber privilege
[9:34 PM] shin (hi): Yeah I feel like I missed out
[9:36 PM] Von Tugen: ya
[9:36 PM] Von Tugen: me too
[9:54 PM] Jade (Vysis): wow
[9:54 PM] shin (hi): low-key wanna react with thinking emojis to all their posts
[9:55 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): lmao
[10:04 PM] Frozen: why did she emphasize the "you are a subscriber" part
[10:04 PM] shin (hi): anythign is possible when you're delusional apparently
[10:04 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Well clearly Cosmos is subscribed to the Discord, not the Twitch :thinking:
[10:04 PM] shin (hi): Jade I'm gonna sub to your twitch and I expect special treatment ok
[10:05 PM] shin (hi): I deserve discord god powers and permanent immunity to all rules in exchange for $5 a month which probably all goes to twitch since you probably don't have enough consistent subs since you stopped streaming
[10:06 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): It accumulates
[10:06 PM] shin (hi): isn't it like 100 in a half year
[10:06 PM] shin (hi): or is it a full year
[10:06 PM] shin (hi): before you can be paid out
[10:06 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): 1 person forgot to unsub to me for 13 months then I got paid my $100 xD
[10:06 PM] shin (hi): LOL
[10:12 PM] Frozen: idk why being kicked from a discord is so offensive to them its literally not that big a deal but whatever
[10:17 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk):
also Frozen when their entire identity is based on talking to people then there's not much else to go off of XD
@shin (hi) Talking to people that they ditched**
[10:18 PM] shin (hi): LOL
[10:18 PM] shin (hi): if they had some substance to fall back on then maybe they wouldn't be so upset over nothing
[10:18 PM] shin (hi): :sip:
[10:19 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): They're lashing out and creating problems with us because they're not mature enough to admit that they feel bad for leaving
[10:19 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): It's like a customer getting mad at the store even though it's the customers fault
[10:19 PM] shin (hi): "why can't I return the cake I ate half of"
[10:20 PM] shin (hi): "i didn't even like it"
[10:20 PM] Frozen: idk to me its like saying "oh yea we left you guys without saying anything, but you guys can't just leave us without saying anything since we're buds"
[10:20 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): ^
[10:20 PM] shin (hi): also people like Caol managed to post in discord and in game
[10:20 PM] shin (hi): to say bye
[10:20 PM] Frozen: of course some of them did say something
[10:20 PM] shin (hi): soooooooooooo
[10:20 PM] Frozen: but i dont recall cosmos doing anything like that
[10:20 PM] shin (hi): I didn't even know he left
[10:21 PM] shin (hi): I don't even know who he is
[10:21 PM] shin (hi): XD
[10:21 PM] Deo Luminai: Honestly I only know who Jie is...
[10:21 PM] Deo Luminai: I ignore like 95% of the FC
[10:21 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I deleted Cosmos' message.
As we're finding out, they didn't even like us. I'm not gonna keep a BS "I'll miss you" message in that case
[10:21 PM] shin (hi): I only know Caol cus he was one of the only ones that like showed an active interest in raiding
[10:21 PM] shin (hi): and Mango cus she decorated my house
[10:22 PM] shin (hi): :02XD:
[10:22 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Sorry, it was Caol's message. Not Cosmos
[10:22 PM] Frozen: idk i feel like its easy to be convinced when you only see 1 side of the story like caol is lol
[10:23 PM] shin (hi): Caol's chill in my book at least for now
[10:23 PM] shin (hi): he's the only one that actually messaged me directly
[10:23 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Saying?
[10:23 PM] Frozen: yea he messaged me too saying he was going to leave with vanz
[10:23 PM] Deo Luminai: Shin is holding out on us
[10:23 PM] Frozen: before he actually left
[10:23 PM] Deo Luminai: Grab the pitchforks
[10:23 PM] Deo Luminai: Kick him from the discord
[10:23 PM] shin (hi):
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/733091864202444800/771559929080578088/unknown.png
[10:24 PM] shin (hi): save ur pitchforks Deo
[10:24 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Oh I thought you meant he messaged you during the manufactured drama they're trying at
[10:24 PM] shin (hi): oh no
[10:24 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I'm less interested now xD
[10:24 PM] shin (hi): yeah
[10:24 PM] Raithe: xD
[10:24 PM] shin (hi): it's basically what the entire thing should have been
[10:25 PM] shin (hi): "hey btw i'm leaving to join the majority of my friends but we still cool"
[10:25 PM] shin (hi): and then I'm just like "sure sounds good cya around"
[10:25 PM] shin (hi): no drama needed
[10:25 PM] shin (hi): lol
[10:25 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I like how they left the FC but are trying their absolute hardest to be apart of it still
[10:26 PM] shin (hi): yeah
[10:26 PM] Raithe: lol
[10:26 PM] shin (hi): like for the followers I kinda get it if their friend circle all left then like sure
[10:26 PM] shin (hi): but the original ones it's like
[10:26 PM] shin (hi): but why

[10:26 PM] Jade (Vysis): cause candy
[10:27 PM] Frozen: im guessing here but i feel like jie probably vented to alt, and alt probably brought up the idea of making a new fc
[10:27 PM] Frozen: thats just me guessing though lol
[10:27 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Or like Mango who didn't know what was even happening xD
[10:27 PM] shin (hi): Mango has no idea what's going on she just followed her friends LOL
[10:27 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): 100% Frozen
[10:27 PM] Frozen: jie and alt are super close so it would make sense
[10:27 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): There's no doubt that Jie vented to Alth, sharing only his side, and she came up with this.
[10:27 PM] shin (hi): I'm curious what he even said
[10:28 PM] shin (hi): or if it was just some boring "I asked for help and they told me to go away" thing
[10:28 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): JADE YELLED AT ME
[10:28 PM] shin (hi): LOL
[10:28 PM] Frozen: probably sometihng along the lines of "you guys aren't giving enough support for my ideas"
[10:28 PM] Frozen: or something i read that phrase a lot
[10:28 PM] shin (hi): yeah jade stop bullying fc members :02XD:
[10:28 PM] shin (hi): OH YEAH
[10:28 PM] shin (hi): "I just would have liked some support"
[10:28 PM] shin (hi): LIKE
[10:28 PM] shin (hi): WHATS THAT EVEN MEAN
[10:28 PM] shin (hi): LOL
[10:28 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): We gave you support but we also gave you a reality check
[10:29 PM] Jade (Vysis): i was also probably one of the nicest to him
[10:29 PM] Jade (Vysis): funny enough
[10:29 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): "I'm trying to shove this Computer monitor up my ass. Please support me and say I can do it"
[10:29 PM] Byeong Ha: like gurl im your husband
[10:29 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): like... no, you can't
[10:29 PM] Byeong Ha: stop acting like a child
[10:29 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): no kidding, byeong
[10:29 PM] Frozen: are you still married in game
[10:29 PM] Byeong Ha: i discarded his ring
[10:29 PM] Byeong Ha: so i guess im divorced
[10:29 PM] Byeong Ha: lmao
[10:29 PM] Jade (Vysis): but i want candy so let me be a child
[10:29 PM] Frozen: is that how divorce work in game lmao
[10:30 PM] Jade (Vysis): yes it is
[10:30 PM] Byeong Ha: yeah
[10:30 PM] Frozen: wow thats so quick and easy lol
[10:30 PM] Jade (Vysis): just like real divorce
[10:31 PM] Jade (Vysis): also, im sure if i hadn't "yelled" at him for being childish about the whole raiding thing, they'd all still be here
[10:31 PM] Jade (Vysis): so just let me be the bad guy
[10:31 PM] Raithe: I don't mean to offend but when did Frozen become officer? I've missed a lot since I've been gone/afk from FFXIV
[10:31 PM] Frozen: im sure he would have still vented about not getting support from other officers
[10:31 PM] Frozen: ti was kind of recent lol
[10:31 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Lmao Raithe
[10:32 PM] Frozen: aurk just asked me randomly
[10:32 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Raithe and Frozen
[10:32 PM] Raithe: xD
[10:32 PM] Frozen: im glad i accepted because now i can read this
[10:32 PM] Frozen: i dont like being a part of drama but i like reading about it
[10:32 PM] Frozen: X D
[10:33 PM] shin (hi): I'm having a great time
[10:33 PM] Deo Luminai: Right?
[10:33 PM] Deo Luminai: Daytime soaps are the way to go
[10:33 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): It's so much fun, especially since the drama is entirely on their side and we're here like "LOL"
[10:33 PM] Frozen: shin gets front row seats tho
[10:33 PM] Raithe: I honestly don't remember a whole lot of FC people. I just remember Jiesus and his snowflake mentality
[10:34 PM] Jade (Vysis): look i dont mind the whole thing too much, but i dont want them attempting to reach out to members and spreading this shit
[10:34 PM] Deo Luminai: It was very hard controlling Raithe when Jiesus was here lol
[10:34 PM] Raithe: ^
[10:34 PM] Frozen: yea hes a bit of the complaining type lul
[10:35 PM] Frozen: which is ok sometimes
[10:35 PM] Frozen: but like complaining about pf after 2 days of pf
[10:35 PM] Deo Luminai: It's fine if it's warranted...but he would complain about everything...xD I mean literally everything
[10:35 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): He wanted to be carried in a group of 7 FC members that have cleared
[10:36 PM] Deo Luminai: "Omg you guys don't take my suggestions on events at all. You never do what I want stop hating on me" xD Because your ideas suck
[10:36 PM] Frozen: what did he suggest before?
[10:36 PM] Raithe: Frozen, you should get a discord profile pic
[10:36 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Well... an FC event forcing vets to carry him, for one
[10:37 PM] Frozen: I’ve been thinking about it the discord default image stands out in a bad way lol
[10:37 PM] Deo Luminai: Like for the giveaways, it was unanimous that winners not be allowed to sell the prizes because officers (Mostly Von and Bye) spent days crafting/gathering it all...and Jiesus said that was bs and that they can do whatever they want with it. xD But we out voted him and he got all QQ

[10:50 PM] shin (hi): also yeah like
[10:50 PM] shin (hi): Jie joined Caol's group yesterday when I was shotcalling them through iconclasm
[10:50 PM] shin (hi): and then left after 5th pull cus we kept making mistakes
[10:50 PM] shin (hi): LOL
[10:50 PM] shin (hi): "I just can't deal with this anymore"
[10:50 PM] shin (hi): he legit just wants to be carried
[10:50 PM] Raithe: Sounds like it
[10:51 PM] Frozen: ???????
[10:51 PM] Raithe: New raiding tier is going to be painful for him then
[10:51 PM] shin (hi): and I know at some point in the past he said something along the lines of "i know i'm a good player I shouldn't have to deal with PF"
[10:51 PM] shin (hi): ???????
[10:51 PM] Frozen: what
[10:51 PM] Raithe: I know someone like that
[10:51 PM] shin (hi): bruh no offense but no one that's been raiding for <1 month is good
[10:52 PM] shin (hi): I mean ffs I wouldn't even consider myself particularly good I've just run these fights a million times
[10:52 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): BUT HE RAIDED IN RUNESCAPE
[10:52 PM] Deo Luminai: Wait
[10:52 PM] Deo Luminai: Runescape has raids?
[10:52 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Apparently lmao
[10:52 PM] shin (hi): tf
[10:52 PM] shin (hi): lmao
[10:52 PM] Raithe: They said "I shouldn't have to use cooldowns. If I play good enough I don't need them"
[10:52 PM] shin (hi): ?
[10:52 PM] shin (hi): yeah
[10:52 PM] shin (hi): if u spec enough into ur dodge stat
[10:52 PM] Deo Luminai: She who must not be named
[10:52 PM] shin (hi): and hit all the frame perfect inputs
[10:53 PM] shin (hi): u don't have to use cd's
[10:53 PM] shin (hi): :smile:
[10:53 PM] Deo Luminai: I wish we could spec into dodge
[10:54 PM] Deo Luminai: All the raid wide damage dodged
[10:54 PM] Deo Luminai: and then healers can just dps more
[10:54 PM] Raithe: Dodge is such a horrible stat though
[10:54 PM] Raithe: If you don't dodge you take way more dmg then normal tank would
[10:54 PM] shin (hi): just get a dodge button
[10:54 PM] shin (hi): like gw2
[10:55 PM] Raithe: xD
[10:55 PM] shin (hi): then u can flame tank for not dodging all the busters
[10:55 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): That's pretty much how the Juggernaut tank was in Star Wars
[10:55 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): All Defense stat (dodge)
[10:55 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Take all the damage or none
[10:55 PM] Raithe: ^
[10:56 PM] Frozen: also yea idk how jie is going to raid next tier if hes complaining about current tier when everyone is gear carried lol
[10:57 PM] shin (hi): he's not going to
[10:57 PM] shin (hi): if you ask me
[10:57 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Only Caol and maybe Ramu will clear the first 2 fights
[10:57 PM] shin (hi): he might try it in the first week or two, get impatient, skip until the end of the tier again, then complain when no one will help him
[10:57 PM] shin (hi): Caol I think might go all the way next tier
[10:58 PM] shin (hi): I think he has a group lined up
[10:58 PM] shin (hi): I think he'll eventually get 12
[10:58 PM] Frozen: caol ramu vanz paris
[10:58 PM] Frozen: are probably raiding together
[10:58 PM] shin (hi): vanz only if he gets real internet
[10:58 PM] Frozen: X D
[10:58 PM] shin (hi): nah caol found a different group I think
[10:58 PM] shin (hi): not them
[10:58 PM] Frozen: oh he does have a static rn but i didnt know he was planning on staying with them
[10:58 PM] shin (hi): not sure either
[10:59 PM] shin (hi): but yeah I don't know if caol will make it through shiva by 5.4 but I can definitely see it beign possible for him to clear 12
[10:59 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): If they clear the tier it'll be after they've done the previous 3 fights 200 times. I'm sorry but Ramu ain't good. I was out dpsing him on my SCH
[10:59 PM] shin (hi): how long has Ramu been playing?
[10:59 PM] shin (hi): I know Caol is very new
[11:00 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): No idea
[11:00 PM] shin (hi): but I think his attitude is good enough
[11:00 PM] shin (hi): good mindset
[11:00 PM] Frozen: ramus gotten better from what ive seen
[11:00 PM] Frozen: after clearing a few times
[11:00 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Strata Dragoon (old FC member) cleared the tier and he started playing XIV in March 2020
[11:00 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Being new isn't really an excuse. Shin being a good example too
[11:00 PM] shin (hi): excuse me I am not good
[11:00 PM] shin (hi): I just netdeck all my strats
[11:00 PM] Frozen: shin is an anomaly cant use him as baseline
[11:00 PM] shin (hi): i'm a copycat
[11:00 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Insert purple and orange parses
[11:00 PM] shin (hi): :smile:
[11:01 PM] shin (hi): insert week 200 meme
[11:01 PM] shin (hi): I also put hundreds of hours into this tier
[11:01 PM] shin (hi): I'm definitely not normal
[11:01 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I mean, you have purple and orange parses, so I'd say you're good, although I will say those purple parses came at a time where literally only you were raiding. All the top raiders aren't there to skew the leaderboards
[11:02 PM] shin (hi): my biggest strength is that I'm fucking insane and I'll grind this shit out and I don't believe in giving up
[11:03 PM] shin (hi): and yeah if you compare my best parse in like 7 to the parses from 5.2, I'm like 2-300 dps behind rank 100
[11:03 PM] shin (hi): on gnb
[11:03 PM] shin (hi): which is a lot
[11:04 PM] shin (hi): also it's kinda hard to gauge skill when it's week 200
[11:04 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): xD
[11:04 PM] shin (hi): fights have all been memorized
[11:04 PM] shin (hi): and it's just "press buttons"
[11:04 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Yeah. We do them without even thinking of mechanics
[11:04 PM] shin (hi): you lose the context of how fast can you prog, how many mistakes do you make learning mechanics, how fast can you optimize on the fly etc
[11:05 PM] shin (hi): which are all pretty integral parts of player skill
[11:05 PM] shin (hi): imo
[11:05 PM] shin (hi): watching a guide and memorizing what to do and then pressing buttons isn't that hard
[11:05 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Yeah. They have the benefit of being 20+ ilvl higher than we were when we progged too
[11:05 PM] shin (hi): throwback to my 300 PF Ramuh pulls
[11:06 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): We cleared it in less than 30 pulls I think
[11:06 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): (after you joined the team)
[11:06 PM] shin (hi): yeah
[11:06 PM] shin (hi): something like that
[11:06 PM] shin (hi): PF is a clown fiesta
[11:06 PM] Deo Luminai: Yes, yes it is
[11:11 PM] shin (hi): but yeah fights are definitely a lot easier now
[11:11 PM] shin (hi): I talked mango through the entire fight blind and we saw liek 4% enrage on the 5th pull or something
[11:11 PM] shin (hi): lol
[11:16 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Adds are a literal joke now
[11:17 PM] shin (hi): say that the group that wiped to it like 20 times this orning
8:18 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Any more drama on their discord? Lmao
[8:24 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I like how they're still trying to poach people lmao
[8:25 AM] Jade (Vysis): Did more leave?
[8:26 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Major Hor and Bass Arnor
[8:26 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): People I have no idea even still play xD
[8:27 AM] Jade (Vysis): I dont recognize those names
[8:28 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Exactly lmao
[8:28 AM] Jade (Vysis): Did they just leave or actually go to their FC
[8:29 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Yes
[8:29 AM] Jade (Vysis): Yes to which one
[8:29 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): The second
[8:29 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Why do you think I said they poached them? :P
[11:01 AM] shin (hi): Lmao I think they might sell out and let me pick their name/tag :bloblaughing:
[11:01 AM] shin (hi): I guess you guys were right
[11:01 AM] shin (hi): I actually am the mafia
[11:01 AM] shin (hi): Guess I should embrace it
[11:02 AM] shin (hi): Using my funds gained by crashing various world's materia markets to exert my influence on other communities
[11:06 AM] Jade (Vysis): Breandyn messaged me this morning that Jie reached out to him. Jie is upset that no one reached out after he left and Braendyn has asked that I talk to him
[11:07 AM] Raithe: So Jiesus is upset that he couldn't take our members?
[11:08 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): He's upset that he ghosted us and we didn't try talking to him like a desperate ex
[11:09 AM] Raithe: To be fair, he's not our problem anymore. He made his bed so let him lay on it.
[11:09 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Like a puppy
[11:10 AM] Raithe: Except puppies are actually tolerable
[11:11 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Not all puppies
[11:12 AM] shin (hi): I dislike animals
[11:13 AM] shin (hi): Also is Jie legitimately delusional
[11:13 AM] Raithe: As are most snowflakes
[11:13 AM] shin (hi): There's no way someone can be this way
[11:13 AM] shin (hi): how do u live life like this
[11:14 AM] Raithe: idk, ask my soon to be ex. She's just like Jiesus
[11:14 AM] Raithe: probably worse actually
[11:14 AM] Jade (Vysis): I don't know.  I have no idea why he wants me to to talk to him
[11:17 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Even if your ex has similar qualities to Jiesus, she's got many many MANY other qualities that throw her over the edge :joy:
[11:18 AM] shin (hi): Do these people enjoy constantly feeling like victims
[11:18 AM] shin (hi): where's the sense of personal responsibility
[11:18 AM] shin (hi): or pride
[11:18 AM] shin (hi): or like
[11:18 AM] shin (hi): idk
[11:18 AM] shin (hi): brain matter
[11:19 AM] Frozen: leave without saying anything -> why doesn’t anyone care??
[11:19 AM] Frozen: what did he even want people to talk to him about
[11:19 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): How sad he is
[11:19 AM] Raithe: xD
[11:19 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Much sad, very upset
[11:20 AM] Jade (Vysis): I have no idea
[11:20 AM] Jade (Vysis): I'm more concerned why he's talking to brand new members and using them to send me messages
[11:21 AM] shin (hi): There's no rules when u live in fantasy land Jade
[11:21 AM] Jade (Vysis): This is final fantasy so I have no rules either?
[11:21 AM] shin (hi): Should turn it on him. Tell him how distraught you are he didn't say goodbye before leaving
[11:21 AM] shin (hi): Really over-act it too
[11:22 AM] shin (hi): Can you cry on demand
[11:22 AM] Frozen: honestly not a terrible idea
[11:22 AM] Jade (Vysis): I cannot cry on demand
[11:22 AM] Frozen: lmao
[11:22 AM] Jade (Vysis): But I can think of really sad stories
[11:22 AM] Jade (Vysis): And eventually cry
[11:22 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Once there was this 3 legged puppy...
[11:22 AM] shin (hi): that's one more leg than it needs
[11:22 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): LOL
[11:23 AM] Jade (Vysis): Shin, wtf
[11:23 AM] Jade (Vysis): Are you a psycho
[11:23 AM] Jade (Vysis): Now I'm crying
[11:24 AM] Raithe: I mean....I've seen dogs on 2 legs before so he isn't wrong
[11:24 AM] Jade (Vysis): Both of you go to the corner
[11:24 AM] Frozen: how does breandyn feel about this tho like I’m not a fan of them continuously talking to people like this
[11:25 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I don't care for it either but I'm not gonna smack him on the nose with a rolled up newspaper and say "No!"
[11:25 AM] Raithe: Yea, kind of shitty imo. He should have just came to Jade or Swarles if he had issues and wanted to talk inside of using others.

[11:26 AM] Jade (Vysis):

[11:26 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): He's scared of us. We openly yelled at him and he's cowarding
[11:26 AM] Jade (Vysis):

[11:27 AM] Raithe: We can just decline the invite...
[11:27 AM] Jade (Vysis): He thinks he's a good guy and that this is all a rom-com that we just need to talk it out
[11:27 AM] Jade (Vysis): That's why I was kinda vague in my answer
[11:27 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Well then tell him the truth. They left us and have been shit talking us and trying to poach members.
[11:27 AM] Jade (Vysis): Mmhmm
[11:28 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): He's not a nice guy. He's just gay. That doesn't automatically give you a free pass to be an ass :stuck_out_tongue:
[11:28 AM] Raithe: It doesn't? Wtf
[11:28 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Lmao
[11:28 AM] Raithe: first the subscriber privilege and now no gay privilege
[11:28 AM] Frozen: My main gripe is I think it’s a kinda a bad move to just up and leave without saying anything when you have an officer role
[11:28 AM] Raithe: I really need to start reading the fine print
[11:29 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Lmao
[11:29 AM] shin (hi): look if we can survive with two legs then so can dogs. Evolve or get left behind imo
[11:29 AM] shin (hi): :02Sip:
[11:29 AM] Jade (Vysis): Anyone leaving is fine, but if you dont say anything dont come back griping that we're mean for not reaching out/ removing you from the discord
[11:29 AM] Frozen: but yea it’s up to you if you want to tell breandyn about our side of the story
[11:30 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): At this point, I'm fine making an announcement about what they're doing :stuck_out_tongue:
[11:30 AM] Raithe: They have those wheel things for dogs with 2 legs. If anything they could go faster than dogs with 4 legs
[11:30 AM] Jade (Vysis): I didn't tell him anything  I said I'll talk to Jie. After whatever nonsense Jie  tells me I'll see what needs to be said
[11:31 AM] shin (hi): oh shit raithe you're right
[11:31 AM] shin (hi): wait can I get one of those?
[11:31 AM] Raithe: xD
[11:31 AM] shin (hi): I wanna have wheels
[11:32 AM] Jade (Vysis): We cant say they're shit talking us yet cause we have no way of "knowing" that
[11:32 AM] Jade (Vysis): As in they'll know their discord is leaked
[11:32 AM] Jade (Vysis): So let me just hear whatever he wants to say to me
[11:33 AM] Frozen: imagine thinking your discord isn’t leaked when 2 officers from our fc are in it
[11:33 AM] Frozen: Lmfao
[11:33 AM] shin (hi): To be fair we do have the nasty messages from Cosmos to Aurk
[11:33 AM] shin (hi): but that's not really enough to say they're all shit talking us
[11:33 AM] shin (hi): and tbf they aren't really it's just a few of them
[11:33 AM] shin (hi): everyone else is just collateral of having questionable friends
[11:33 AM] shin (hi): xD
[11:34 AM] Frozen: yea that seems like the case most of them just left because a few wanted to leave for whatever reason
[11:34 AM] shin (hi): It's ok I'll have the final laugh when I make their FC be called Flock of Mangos
[11:34 AM] shin (hi): :bloblaughing:
[11:34 AM] Raithe: Nice
[11:34 AM] shin (hi): I love being rich
[11:35 AM] Deo Luminai: I'd make an announcement and explain what they are doing.
[11:35 AM] Deo Luminai: :stuck_out_tongue: but also let me see it first
[11:35 AM] Deo Luminai: I'm amazing at PR
[11:36 AM] Raithe: No
[11:36 AM] Raithe: Shin and I first

[11:36 AM] Raithe: I'll talk to Jiesus for you
[11:36 AM] Frozen: I think it makes sense for jade to see what joe says first before making any announcement
[11:36 AM] shin (hi): Is this an angel and devil on the shoulder scenario
[11:36 AM] Deo Luminai: Go back on your leash
[11:36 AM] Deo Luminai: I didn't let you off
[11:36 AM] Frozen: jie**
[11:36 AM] shin (hi): or a double devil scenario
[11:36 AM] Raithe: Double devil sounds fun
[11:36 AM] shin (hi): But frozen they're not making any sense why should we have to
[11:37 AM] shin (hi): that's not fair :frowning:
[11:37 AM] Frozen: I’m not saying we should make an announcement
[11:37 AM] Frozen: I’m saying we should at least wait if we were to make an announcement
[11:37 AM] Frozen: xd
[11:37 AM] Jade (Vysis): We should wait
[11:37 AM] shin (hi): That's no fun
[11:37 AM] shin (hi): I want more sitcom episodes
[11:37 AM] Jade (Vysis): Let them continue to make asses of themselves to our members
[11:37 AM] Deo Luminai: Frozen, that would have made sense if it happened earlier. However Jie poached members and is playing the victim to get any attention he can. He lost the right to have a "calm resolution"
[11:37 AM] shin (hi): :KRPopcorn:
[11:38 AM] Jade (Vysis): We shouldn't dirty our reputation by making more announcements about them
[11:38 AM] shin (hi): We should just start saying "sorry who?" whenever they're brought up
[11:38 AM] shin (hi): "oh I remember them vaguely"
[11:39 AM] Raithe: I guess we should be the bigger person...but only because we'd have bigger fists
[11:39 AM] shin (hi): "werent they the ones that complained we didn't carry them thru savage?"
[11:39 AM] Frozen: wasn’t jie the only one
[11:39 AM] Jade (Vysis): I'd also rather this be a fun place for what members remain. I get that they started this crap but I'd rather not play
[11:39 AM] Frozen: but he did say he was talking on behalf for others
[11:39 AM] Deo Luminai: Not dirty. Simply saying what is going on. Braendyn is already seeing them as the good guys because we tried to be the bigger person. We don't have to give specifics but we can just say "They are still welcome back, however they have been saying hurtful things about the FC and trying to poach members in a way to hurt the FC" xD And bam. We didn't sully our reputation and we didn't tell anyone to hate them
[11:40 AM] shin (hi): Deo is a much better candidate for PR
[11:40 AM] shin (hi): but I feel like me and Raithe would make it more fun
[11:40 AM] Raithe: yea yea i guess
[11:40 AM] shin (hi): I just wanna watch the chaos
[11:40 AM] shin (hi): :02Sip:
[11:40 AM] Jade (Vysis): And how do we know they say hurtful things? Reveal you guys are in their discord?
[11:41 AM] Deo Luminai: We don't have to give proof. Jie has given no proof of the stuff we've done
[11:41 AM] Jade (Vysis): Alright, but let me talk to Jie first. Let him see what he has to say for himself
[11:42 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I get waiting.
[11:42 AM] Jade (Vysis): If he ever responds
[11:42 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): But there's no reveal. They openly invited two officers to their discord
[11:42 AM] Jade (Vysis): Okay
[11:44 AM] shin (hi): It's 2020 proof is optional now
[11:44 AM] shin (hi): you just have to tell a more convincing story
[11:44 AM] shin (hi): extra points for three-legged dog elements
[11:44 AM] Deo Luminai: They kind of drew the line when they started to poach members that they don't even know. I get the whole "taking my friends with me!" ok gl hf...but to start messaging brand new people to steal them...yea xD They are being petty
[11:44 AM] shin (hi): "we don't want drama with wipe" btw
[11:49 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Did someone just say that? Lol
[11:50 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I should join them on my dummy account
[12:09 PM] Jade (Vysis): Okay, I explained things to Braendyn
[12:24 PM] Byeong Ha: Waking up to 162+ messages
[12:25 PM] Byeong Ha: Thanks everyone good work :joy::joy:
[12:25 PM] Jade (Vysis): You're welcome
[12:29 PM] Byeong Ha: But hum honestly sorry not sorry but fuck those kids? You can’t just leave the fc as an OFFFICER and tell literally nobody about it. Then try to poach OUR members trying to make them believe filthy lies? That’s not how it works. Leave with your friends and never come back idc. We were always open to suggestion and offered help, and we still will for our fc members. But we’re in no obligation to help or care about a small ass trash fc that just started on the side of the street because one person was unhappy about being unable to attend organized raid schedule. This is such childish behaviour from their side and if they try to pull off another move like that, I’m crushing them idc.
[12:29 PM] Byeong Ha: Thank you, next.
[12:29 PM] Byeong Ha: It’s Christmas let’s go home.
[12:30 PM] Jade (Vysis): Damn Byeong
[12:30 PM] Jade (Vysis): Angry lala
[12:30 PM] Jade (Vysis): Bite their ankles
[12:33 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Lmao
[12:34 PM] Byeong Ha: In what world did we have to reach out to every single fc members to know why they left??? We have over what 200+ members and some I don’t even know
[12:34 PM] Byeong Ha: They left good for them. Don’t try to make us guilty for it da fk
[12:34 PM] Jade (Vysis): No no, we're guilty cause of their subscription privileges
[12:34 PM] Jade (Vysis): xD
[12:35 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Initially we were thinking we'd take any of them back with the exception of Alth (this was her idea) and Jie (being a snowflake) but now they all lose that privilege
[12:35 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): And yes. I say privilege. It's a privilege to be I'm the biggest FC on the server
[12:36 PM] Byeong Ha: Never like alth lol
[12:36 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): :p
[12:36 PM] Byeong Ha: Gives off bad vibes
[12:36 PM] Jade (Vysis): Cause she stole your husband?
[12:36 PM] Jade (Vysis): Jk
[12:36 PM] Byeong Ha: My ex husband
[12:36 PM] Byeong Ha: Pls
[12:36 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Someone made a complaint about her within the first 2 weeks she joined
[12:36 PM] Byeong Ha: Lmao
[12:38 PM] Jade (Vysis): Next we wait for Von to yell at us for all the messages he has to read
[12:38 PM] Byeong Ha: :joy::joy:
[12:38 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Lmao
[12:38 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Von likes grinds though.
[12:38 PM] Byeong Ha: Shin and raithe talking about 3 legs dogs through the drama :man_facepalming:
[12:39 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): :joy:
[12:39 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): It's like in Brooklyn 99 when they're making a bust but never drop their casual conversation
[1:04 PM] shin (hi): I suggested they name their FC the "You Don't Pay My Sub" FC
[1:05 PM] shin (hi): also yes Aurk they have a rule specifically saying they don't want drama between the two FCs lol
[1:06 PM] Jade (Vysis): "But omg they kicked you and you're a subscriber...wtf"
[1:06 PM] shin (hi): you forgot the italics
[1:06 PM] Jade (Vysis): I'm lazy and on mobile
[1:06 PM] shin (hi): smh
[1:07 PM] Jade (Vysis): No they way Byeong does it
Smh my head
[1:07 PM] Jade (Vysis): Its better
[1:07 PM] shin (hi): stolen meme
[1:07 PM] shin (hi): 5/10
[1:07 PM] shin (hi): @Byeong Ha
[1:40 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): So I see they've already broken their rule lmao

[2:39 PM] Jade (Vysis): Look I'm not about to tell the 3 gay officers in here what's gay and what's not
[2:39 PM] Jade (Vysis): So if they tell me I am, then I have no argument
[2:39 PM] shin (hi): everything is gay if u believe hard enough

[2:42 PM] Deo Luminai: ...lol...
[2:42 PM] Deo Luminai: adps is basically useless
[2:43 PM] shin (hi): adps only tells you how well you're holding shit for buffs... which is pointless unless you have a static group in which case you just use kill time
[2:43 PM] shin (hi): XD
[2:43 PM] Byeong Ha: i mean
[2:43 PM] shin (hi): all those metrics are pointless
[2:43 PM] Raithe: whatever, let them fuck up their own raid team

[2:45 PM] shin (hi): and then if u want pink u just pray all ur dances crit
[2:46 PM] shin (hi): and if they don't u say gg shit game no crits
[2:46 PM] Jade (Vysis): That's gonna be my new motto: Boom Purple
[2:46 PM] shin (hi): cries in 89k technical finish
[2:47 PM] Deo Luminai: That's why SMN utility is so good
[2:47 PM] Deo Luminai: You don't have to align Devotion with anything
[2:47 PM] Deo Luminai: because outside of opener it never aligns anyways ;p
[2:47 PM] shin (hi): i hate
[2:47 PM] shin (hi): 3 minute cds
[2:47 PM] shin (hi): they're so awkward
[2:48 PM] Deo Luminai: They are
[2:48 PM] shin (hi): if they would stop putting random shit happening at 3m in every fucking fight
[2:48 PM] shin (hi): maybe it wouldn't be so bad
[2:48 PM] shin (hi): "oh what if shiva just leaves at like 3:10 fuck u buffs btw"
[2:48 PM] shin (hi): "what if we just spawn e7 adds at 3:15 fuck u"
[2:49 PM] Deo Luminai: Well and to make it worse for SMN...it takes about 5 secs to even cast the buff xD So lose out on it even more in those situations
[2:49 PM] shin (hi): yeah
[2:49 PM] shin (hi): so dumb
[2:49 PM] shin (hi): 5 sec for pet to actually cast
[2:49 PM] shin (hi): like 1.5 seconds for the buff to propagate
[2:49 PM] shin (hi): nice 8 second raid buff
[2:50 PM] Deo Luminai: And you know...the cancelling of devotion if you summon phoenix or bahamut
[2:51 PM] shin (hi): pets are a good game mechanic :slight_smile:
[2:51 PM] Deo Luminai: Forcing them to delay literally the one mechanic that controls their entire rotation >:C
[2:51 PM] shin (hi): that's like 80% I haven't learned smn yet
[2:51 PM] shin (hi): I don't want to deal with pet AI i'll just get mad
[2:52 PM] Deo Luminai: It's so bad xD "Hey lets make it so your pet casts your spells for you!" That's great...except that it can only que up 3 actions so it gets cancelled after that...
[2:52 PM] shin (hi): what if the pet just had 32mb of ram
[2:53 PM] shin (hi): game coded by interns
[2:53 PM] Deo Luminai: Would perform better than it does now
[2:53 PM] shin (hi): i already get annoyed by eos
[2:53 PM] shin (hi): can't imagine how annoyed I will get by my topaz carbuncle

[9:21 PM] Deo Luminai: They can try. xD
[9:22 PM] Raithe: They took everything just wrong xD
they chose only the parts they wanted
[9:22 PM] Deo Luminai: It's amusing how he never really states his point...just repeating facts. His sub doesn't matter. Jade hasn't streamed in a long time.
[9:22 PM] shin (hi): but Deo
[9:22 PM] shin (hi): he's a subscriber
[9:23 PM] shin (hi): omgggggg

[9:26 PM] Raithe: Then stop poaching members, shit talking about members/officers and only taking what could be construed as negative to the wrong people from the conversations we have.
[9:29 PM] Deo Luminai: Lets be real here...they have Jiesus in a position of power over there.
[9:29 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I wanna message him and say "Awe, did I hurt your poor sensitive, snowflake feelings?"
[9:29 PM] Deo Luminai: They are fucked.
[9:29 PM] Deo Luminai: He wanted to ban people for saying "That's gay"
[9:29 PM] Deo Luminai: So yea...xD gl to that fc
[9:31 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Poor baby got his feelings hurt
[9:31 PM] shin (hi): Bridge must have been made of gasoline tbh
[9:32 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I'll send them all these screenshots and say "Did you really think Jie join you guys for YOUR benefit?" lmao

[9:38 PM] shin (hi): classy
[9:38 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): That's not offensive but saying "That's gay" is bannable
[9:39 PM] Deo Luminai: If they change it to that xD Just report them. SE will force them to change it or disband the fc
[9:39 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): True
[9:39 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Shin, please back that name up. Support it

[10:14 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Just put them down like retarded horses and move on :p
