[1:13 PM] A Random Badger: who's the other offlaner on my team?
[1:13 PM] A Random Badger: emotion?
[1:13 PM] A Random Badger: i thought he was mid player
[1:13 PM] fancy: jules
[1:13 PM] A Random Badger: oh i didnt know he played offlane
[1:13 PM] fancy: offlaner frequently
[1:13 PM] A Random Badger: maybe ill let him offlane some and give him tips
[1:14 PM] A Random Badger: so im not the only decent offlaner in taw anymore
[1:14 PM] fancy: if you want to win put him on sb or es
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: sb offlane? or do you mean for 4th pos?
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: i dont like sb offlane tbh
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: i think it's inefficient
[1:15 PM] fancy: 4 u dolt
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: good
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: cause i know
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: SOME
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: PEOPLE
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: IN TAW
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: PLAY IT OFFLANE
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: AND ITS
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: BAD
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: BUT THEY ALL LIKE
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: "OMG THIS FEELS SO GOOD"
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: LIKE NO
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: YOU SHOULD FEEL
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: TERRIBLE
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: IT IT
[1:16 PM] A Random Badger: IT IS
[1:16 PM] A Random Badger: THE BAD
[1:16 PM] A Random Badger: BADNESS
[1:16 PM] A Random Badger: THE BAD BADNESS
[1:21 PM] fancy: it's good in duals
[1:22 PM] A Random Badger: i feel like its just inefficient pos wise yanno unless you have like a 3rd pos jungler or something? because i feel like giving an sb 3rd priority of farm is lackluster tbh
[1:23 PM] fancy: what
[1:23 PM] fancy: duals doesn't mean he gets to farm
[1:24 PM] fancy: duals means he slays
[1:24 PM] fancy: u go lich sb
[1:24 PM] fancy: or ds sb
[1:24 PM] fancy: and fucking
[1:24 PM] fancy: man up
[1:24 PM] fancy: lol
[1:25 PM] A Random Badger: ohhh i thought you meant something else, yea i think thats fine as long as you either have 2 greedy farmers and 3 supports including the sb or like a greedy jungler or smth
[1:26 PM] A Random Badger: cause i just feel like you otherwise dont take good advantage of gold resources from the map in just normal scenario especially if the sb dual lane ends up doing nothing
[1:26 PM] A Random Badger: have an insurance policy basically
[1:26 PM] fancy: eh
[1:26 PM] fancy: that's like
[1:26 PM] fancy: questionable
[1:27 PM] fancy: you need heroes that capitalize on sb's function
[1:27 PM] fancy: and heroes that push towers early preferably
[1:27 PM] A Random Badger: yea i suppose but even that i feel like will only work in situational matchups
[1:28 PM] fancy: wat
[1:28 PM] fancy: are we talking about sb in general
[1:28 PM] A Random Badger: no sb as offlaner
[1:29 PM] A Random Badger: whether dual or solo
[1:29 PM] A Random Badger: did you think i was talking about him in general?
[1:29 PM] fancy: it's like running an ns
[1:29 PM] fancy: as a jungling 4
[1:29 PM] fancy: cus no kill potential
[1:30 PM] fancy: but you use him anyway by taking towers to open the map
[1:30 PM] fancy: and then he gets to run wild
[1:31 PM] A Random Badger: yea but that wouldnt work against certain matchups that are prepared to defend against it or something thats just easily better in the early game and prevents you from taking that chance
[1:31 PM] fancy: I mean you don't run sb against heroes that are good against sv
[1:31 PM] fancy: sb
[1:31 PM] fancy: lol
[1:32 PM] fancy: you'd run an sb dual lane against a weak dual or solo hero
[1:39 PM] A Random Badger: well what i mean is, like if you're gonna run him at all. at least as a pos 4, he can still do stuff and create kill potential and apply pressure on the map and there's not that many heroes that can really prevent that and even if theres heroes who can like stop him later in the game it wont matter if the sb does his job in the early game because he's only a pos 4. but if he's a pos 3 dual laning in the off with a pos 4 lich or w.e yea it's really situational because theres things that can prevent him from doing the things he wants to accomplish and he basically forfeits the early game pressure he could have as a pos 4 and i think you can go 2 seperate strategies with that scenario. one where you can go all-in kinda on like tower pushing and dominating middle game and winning at 30 minutes or w.e or you can go for a strategy where you have 2 greedy farmers who take advantage of the whle map's worth of farm since your 3rd pos sb is really just a 2nd 4th pos and since he should be applying a lot of pressure on the enemy safelane and forcing rotations that free up farm for your pos 1 and 2. my problem is people like in taw or low mmr will just pick him like a standard offlaner and it's just really inefficent because not not only are you not pressuring the map or getting kills but you're allowing him 3rd priority of farm that is absolutely useless for him and your team like you may as well have just not had a 5th hero at all and only farmed 2/3 of the map
[1:40 PM] fancy: you aren't forfeiting the pressure tho
[1:40 PM] fancy: you're forcing both supports to remain in the safelane
[1:40 PM] fancy: because your dual lane is so powerful
[1:40 PM] fancy: or the carry doesn't farm
[1:40 PM] fancy: it's not the same pressure sure
[1:40 PM] fancy: he's not killing the mid laner
[1:40 PM] fancy: but at the same time
[1:41 PM] fancy: he's giving his mid a pure 1v1
[1:41 PM] fancy: and also accelerating his timing window by having guaranteed experience
[1:41 PM] fancy: because roaming is by nature unreliable
[1:42 PM] fancy: a solo SB never really kills anyone unless he's just way too fat
[1:42 PM] fancy: so you always need a friend
[1:42 PM] fancy: anyway
[1:42 PM] fancy: the tower pushing concept isnt the same as a deathball concept
[1:43 PM] fancy: I just mean if you take all the out towers
[1:43 PM] fancy: heroes like sb and ns and bat vastly spike in usefulness
[1:43 PM] fancy: because they're so good at controlling an open map
[1:43 PM] fancy: and now there's no risk of people tping in to help
[1:44 PM] fancy: so your team uses that hero as a mechanism to just own everything
[1:44 PM] fancy: even if they need to farm for 20 more minutes to break highground
[1:50 PM] A Random Badger: yea i agree with that, like i said my only problem with it is the people who treat sb offlane like a normal offlaner trying to farm and they claim it "feels good" lol
[1:53 PM] fancy: people also claim playing veno feels good
[1:53 PM] fancy: but they only have a single brain cell
[1:53 PM] fancy: they're basically not even people
