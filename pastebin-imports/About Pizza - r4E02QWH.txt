[2:21 AM] fancy: like yesterday
[2:21 AM] fancy: cus after work he went out with friends
[2:21 AM] fancy: and I'm like well no
[2:21 AM] fancy: that is a choice
[2:21 AM] fancy: so even he's not even really being honest with himself about his motivations I suppose
[2:22 AM] fancy: but it's like
[2:22 AM] fancy: fine I guess
[2:22 AM] fancy: it just feels like
[2:22 AM] fancy: what I expected for a long time tbh
[2:22 AM] fancy: where it's like
[2:22 AM] fancy: eventually
[2:22 AM] fancy: he would move on too
[2:22 AM] fancy: get a job
[2:22 AM] fancy: and a life
[2:22 AM] fancy: and want to do other things
[2:23 AM] fancy: and replace the time spent with me with new people
[2:23 AM] fancy: makes me feel stagnant I guess
[2:23 AM] fancy: idn I have a really hard time getting along with people in general
[2:23 AM] fancy: I don't play nice with most people
[2:24 AM] fancy: so I never do anything with anyone like irl
[2:27 AM] saucy: so are you like afraid of losing pizza
[2:27 AM] saucy: or you just don't like it that people around you are doing other things
[2:27 AM] fancy: I'm... not sure
[2:27 AM] saucy: while you feel like you're still stuck with the same routine
[2:27 AM] fancy: I think
[2:27 AM] fancy: honestly before
[2:28 AM] fancy: I felt a lot like the center of attention
[2:28 AM] fancy: I think pizza was more dependent on me before actually
[2:29 AM] fancy: whether it was true or not idk
[2:29 AM] fancy: but it feels different now
[2:29 AM] fancy: when it's like
[2:29 AM] fancy: oh
[2:30 AM] fancy: things happen outside me
[2:30 AM] fancy: and I guess it's
[2:30 AM] fancy: making me feel in ways I wouldn't have expected
[2:30 AM] fancy: cus I always thought I didn't like being the center of attention
[2:30 AM] fancy: maybe I do
[2:33 AM] fancy: https://youtu.be/8fEoWA9Vz3A
[2:33 AM] fancy: I like his voice
[2:37 AM] saucy: so you kind of feel like you've been replaced?
[2:37 AM] saucy: btw i hope you don't mind me asking questions
[2:38 AM] saucy: i'm just trying to understand how you feel
[2:38 AM] saucy: oh i like his voice too
[2:38 AM] saucy: honestly the mv reminded me of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzQ82Ny1ToI
[2:38 AM] saucy: i used to like this back in high school lol
[2:39 AM] fancy: wow not available
[2:39 AM] fancy: thanks obama
[2:39 AM] fancy: and yeah I guess a bit
[2:39 AM] saucy: what the fuck
[2:39 AM] saucy: seriously
[2:39 AM] saucy: one sec
[2:40 AM] saucy: i think what you're feeling is reasonable
[2:40 AM] saucy: nobody wants to be replaced
[2:40 AM] saucy: and i know pizza was like really there for you
[2:41 AM] saucy: but like, at the same time he does have his own life to live
[2:41 AM] saucy: and people do change overtime especially during adulthood
[2:42 AM] saucy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4opY4pgDoHA
[2:42 AM] saucy: hmmmm
[2:43 AM] saucy: do you feel like any resentment towards him for like not spending as much time with you now?
[2:46 AM] fancy: a little bit
[2:47 AM] saucy: do you still play anything with him at all?
[2:47 AM] fancy: I played 1 csgo game today with them but iduno
[2:48 AM] fancy: they dont join discord and I mute in game chat
[2:48 AM] fancy: he was just talking with a friend from work in a different discord
[2:49 AM] fancy: I feel like I should be happy for him that he has a PC that isn't a toaster now
[2:50 AM] fancy: but I do not feel like that
[2:50 AM] fancy: I guess
[2:50 AM] saucy: if i had to guess, and i could be completely wrong, but you should be happy for him since a nice PC is always great
[2:50 AM] saucy: but you feel like every since he got the new PC, he hasn't been spending as much time with you as you'd like?
[2:50 AM] saucy: i think it is kind of rude to not talk to you while you're playing together though
[2:51 AM] saucy: have you asked him to discord with you if you guys play together?
[2:51 AM] fancy: I guess I had a different idea of what it would be like
[2:51 AM] fancy: and iduno it's weird cus like
[2:51 AM] fancy: honestly I find myself being in discord with people during games less and less pleasant
[2:52 AM] fancy: like
[2:52 AM] fancy: so
[2:52 AM] fancy: I've been playing with this other group of people in dota a couple times recently
[2:52 AM] fancy: they don't even have a discord
[2:52 AM] fancy: they just always use in game voice
[2:52 AM] fancy: and honestly I find myself preferring that
[2:53 AM] fancy: I think because there isn't the extraneous noise
[2:53 AM] fancy: because of voice activation
[2:56 AM] saucy: ooooh
[2:56 AM] saucy: so they only say whats relevant
[2:56 AM] saucy: and thats what you prefer?
[2:56 AM] fancy: I think so
[2:56 AM] fancy: I play better that way at least
[2:57 AM] fancy: I get less frustrated
[2:57 AM] fancy: and tilt less
[2:59 AM] saucy: oh, makes sense
[2:59 AM] saucy: do you think you'd prefer that with pizza?
[3:00 AM] fancy: I'm not sure any more tbh
[3:00 AM] fancy: like
[3:00 AM] fancy: half of me doesn't enjoy playing with him sometimes
[3:00 AM] fancy: iduno
[3:00 AM] fancy: I'm conflicted
[3:01 AM] saucy: oooooh
[3:01 AM] fancy: he likes doing stupid shit I guess
[3:01 AM] saucy: hmmm originally i was going to suggest talking to him and ask if you guys can play like a few times together in a week
[3:01 AM] saucy: so you'd rather play seriously?
[3:01 AM] fancy: I always rather play seriously basically
