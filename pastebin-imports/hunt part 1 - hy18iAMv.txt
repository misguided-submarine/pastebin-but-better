[00:13 AM] fancy: my issue was that
[00:13 AM] fancy: you weren't answering my questions at all
[00:13 AM] fancy: which derailed the conversation
[00:13 AM] fancy: so from my perspective
[00:13 AM] A Random Badger: i disagree
[00:13 AM] fancy: you were the one derailing it
[00:14 AM] fancy: of course you disagree you don't think you can be wrong
[00:14 AM] fancy: or ever be mistaken
[00:14 AM] fancy: lol
[00:14 AM] A Random Badger: i think you simply wanted to railroad the entire conversation, by forcing me to answer questions in a specific way
[00:14 AM] A Random Badger: hence the
[00:14 AM] A Random Badger: "yes or no" bs
[00:14 AM] fancy: I only got to that
[00:14 AM] fancy: after you faield to answer them
[00:14 AM] fancy: lol
[00:15 AM] fancy: like ever since you asked me about it I've wondered if I should get it
[00:15 AM] fancy: so I asked questions about it
[00:15 AM] A Random Badger: but
[00:15 AM] fancy: I didn't realize it had out of game progression
[00:15 AM] A Random Badger: the problem is
[00:15 AM] fancy: and as soon as I learned that it killed all interest I had for it
[00:15 AM] A Random Badger: you didnt even qustion the game
[00:15 AM] fancy: which is unfortunate
[00:15 AM] A Random Badger: based off any itnerest for it at all
[00:15 AM] A Random Badger: imo
[00:16 AM] fancy: what does that even mean
[00:16 AM] fancy: why would I ask about it if I didn't care
[00:16 AM] A Random Badger: because like i said
[00:16 AM] fancy: badger let me ask you a question
[00:16 AM] A Random Badger: it wasn't a question of whether or not something interested you, all those questions were about whether or not you should buy the game
[00:16 AM] fancy: okay wait
[00:16 AM] fancy: I will wait on my question
[00:16 AM] fancy: what does that mean
[00:17 AM] fancy: what you just said
[00:17 AM] fancy: of course it was a quesiton of whether I would be interested
[00:17 AM] fancy: that's the same as being worth my time, no?(edited)
[00:17 AM] fancy: if i don't find it interesting, it's not worth my time
[00:17 AM] fancy: and the converse is also true
[00:17 AM] fancy: if I found it interesting it would be worth my time
[00:17 AM] A Random Badger: the problem was
[00:17 AM] A Random Badger: the big problem wa s
[00:18 AM] A Random Badger: you asked one question
[00:18 AM] A Random Badger: a vague one at that
[00:18 AM] A Random Badger: i believe it was
[00:18 AM] A Random Badger: about
[00:18 AM] A Random Badger: what clues had to do with the game
[00:18 AM] A Random Badger: and when i address that
[00:18 AM] fancy: i never asked about cluse
[00:18 AM] A Random Badger: you said you didnt mean it that way
[00:18 AM] fancy: the only thing I asked
[00:18 AM] fancy: was
[00:18 AM] fancy: what is the value of 25$ in game(edited)
[00:18 AM] fancy: compared to completing a contract
[00:19 AM] fancy: if you misunderstood then my bad
[00:19 AM] A Random Badger: this was your question
[00:19 AM] A Random Badger: what is that in relation to completing a contract
[00:19 AM] fancy: but that was the quetsion
[00:19 AM] fancy: yeah
[00:19 AM] fancy: what is that [25$] in relation to [the reward you get for] completing a contract
[00:19 AM] fancy: i.e.
[00:19 AM] fancy: a clue is 25 and a contract is 100
[00:19 AM] A Random Badger: after i stated this
[00:19 AM] A Random Badger: you also get paid like 25$ for each clue you get but other than that thats the only way you can get money
[00:19 AM] fancy: or a clue is 25 and a contract is like 100000
[00:20 AM] fancy: okay so
[00:20 AM] fancy: new questions
[00:20 AM] fancy: "but other than that thats the only way you can get money"
[00:20 AM] A Random Badger: wait
[00:20 AM] A Random Badger: no
[00:20 AM] A Random Badger: im not done
[00:20 AM] fancy: what does that mean
[00:20 AM] A Random Badger: explaining where i interpreted this
[00:20 AM] A Random Badger: the way i saw it was
[00:20 AM] A Random Badger: what is that[the clues] in relation to completing a contract
[00:21 AM] fancy: yeah
[00:21 AM] fancy: I understand that
[00:21 AM] fancy: and that wasn't what i was asking
[00:21 AM] fancy: so I clarified
[00:21 AM] A Random Badger: yes
[00:21 AM] A Random Badger: and then
[00:21 AM] A Random Badger: while i was attempted to explain in another way
[00:21 AM] A Random Badger: to suit that question
[00:21 AM] A Random Badger: i got railroaded into
[00:21 AM] A Random Badger: [y/n]
[00:21 AM] fancy: okay so the answer to the question
[00:21 AM] fancy: "what is 25 in relatino to the reward for a contract"
[00:21 AM] fancy: is like
[00:21 AM] fancy: a number
[00:21 AM] fancy: like what is the reward for completing a contract
[00:22 AM] fancy: can you tell me that lol
[00:22 AM] fancy: can you kinda understand how from my perspective you went off on a tangent
[00:22 AM] A Random Badger: usually like just 75-125 depending on the contract
[00:22 AM] fancy: there you go
[00:22 AM] fancy: boom
[00:22 AM] fancy: and thenw e could have moved on
[00:22 AM] A Random Badger: yes but you didnt directly quesiton that
[00:22 AM] A Random Badger: you elft me to assume
[00:22 AM] A Random Badger: what you were questioning
[00:22 AM] fancy: right
[00:22 AM] fancy: which is why i clarified
[00:22 AM] fancy: julian understood what i meant
