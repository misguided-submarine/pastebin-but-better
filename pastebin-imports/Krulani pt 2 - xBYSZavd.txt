[10:47 PM]

	yes

[10:47 PM]
공상:
	do you remember
	the big disagreement from this game

[10:47 PM]
Nikki:
	him and trace

[10:47 PM]
공상:
	when we were pretending to push top HG
	and they were like

[10:47 PM]
Nikki:
	are farming different lanes

[10:47 PM]
공상:
	we fight here

[10:47 PM]
Nikki:
	the entire game

[10:47 PM]
공상:
	yeah that too
	but
	the big meme
	was
	we grouped top
	and were like
	hey we push
	then enemy team
	is just
	4people bottom
	kills our t2
	and middle I think was also fucked
	so I'm like
	fighting is bad
	here

[10:48 PM]
Nikki:
	yea

[10:48 PM]
공상:
	and then I tp away

[10:48 PM]
Nikki:
	and i already left

[10:48 PM]
공상:
	and they for some reason
	thought that
	lina tp was cd
	adn so was pa
	and then also said
	the only reason
	the enemy team tp'd back
	was cus
	they saw me tp
	and they wouldn't accept what I said
	about it
	and so I look at the replay
	after the game
	they literally
	killed the tp
	t2*
	and isnteantly
	backed
	like literally all 4 of them tp'd
	before we even had a creep wave on the low groudn nex tot hg
	and tehy never saw my tp
	cus I tp'd to behind the t3 in fog
	and I'm just like lol okay guess I validate never trusting people taht aren't me
	xD
	but they were so fucking cock sure
	that
	"the cue we were going off of was lina tp being cd and her being far from teh fight"
	and I'm like
	how are you two so unaware
	lina had travels she can be anywhere
	it was quite upsetting

[10:50 PM]
Nikki:
	hes too heavy
	to carry

[10:50 PM]
공상:
	yea
	I won my lan
	e
	so hard
	invoker was like
	level 7
	and i was 11

[10:51 PM]
Nikki:
	everytime AM starts hitting him
	he starts running
	instead of hitting back
	for double
	like what??

[10:51 PM]
공상:
	redman validting him
	was awful
	underlord is fine

[10:51 PM]
Nikki:
	underlord crushes AM

[10:51 PM]
공상:
	with no mana
	u just
	hit him
	like level 1 is like
	the only time
	that underlord
	might lose a trade
	to am
	maybe

[10:51 PM]
Nikki:
	like how udnerlord works is

[10:51 PM]
공상:
	cus am has good base stats and idn underlords

[10:51 PM]
Nikki:
	when AM goes for cs
	u use firestorm
	and get denies

	safelane medusa
	which I think
	is that heroes' worst lane
	i don't think mirana was the pick but wtf do I pick that game
	I can't pick any am solutions cus they're all die to riki

[10:57 PM]
Nikki:
	i think some omega strong pusher
	and medusa just tanks spells
	and u go hit tower

[10:57 PM]
공상:
	I considered like
	lina
	cus it can also make force
	mb I was supposed to pick pugna?

[10:57 PM]
Nikki:
	not vs am

[10:57 PM]
공상:
	yeah there's that
	maybe it was
	lycan mid time

[10:57 PM]
Nikki:
	lycan visage or clinkz
	or some shit

[10:58 PM]
공상:
	do birbs get silenced by cloud
	that would suck

[10:58 PM]
Nikki:
	if he clouds the birds
	they lose

[10:58 PM]
공상:
	yeah but I meant like
	if I have them
	to liek
	stun someone that's getting gone on
	or something
	like if they just cloud whatever they're going on I can't combo break
	with birbs
	idn
	I wasn't confident in my ability to not lose lane on visage

[10:59 PM]
Nikki:
	we just have 2 extremely tanky front liners

[10:59 PM]
공상:
	and no damage
	xD

[10:59 PM]
Nikki:
	and AM cannot fight
	we just go get aegis
	and then
	put it on medusa
	and then hit towers

[10:59 PM]
공상:
	with our manta

[10:59 PM]
Nikki:

[10:59 PM]
공상:
	honestly if medusa
	didn't make
	pike first
	I think we have a better chacne
	like just going
	mask of madness bkb
	or something
	is probably better
	or maybe like
	mask lance bkb
	then u can like
	do some things

[11:00 PM]
Nikki:
	mask lance bkb
	yeah

[11:00 PM]
공상:
	and it's reasonable

[11:00 PM]
Nikki:
	and by then we go rosh
	at bkb timing

[11:00 PM]
공상:
	and not just a pike that's worthless
	and then if I am birb hero
	I can just
	birb rosh to death
	and not get rp'd
