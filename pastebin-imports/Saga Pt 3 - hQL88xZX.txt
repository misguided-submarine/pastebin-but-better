[12:24 PM] A Random Badger: i still hold the position that she doesnt care
[12:24 PM] A Random Badger: idk why i keep trying
[12:25 PM] fancy: care about what
[12:26 PM] A Random Badger: nothing
[12:26 PM] A Random Badger: we've had the conversation before
[12:26 PM] A Random Badger: numerous times
[12:26 PM] A Random Badger: nvm it
[12:26 PM] A Random Badger: im just over her
[12:26 PM] A Random Badger: at this point
[12:27 PM] A Random Badger: she prefers you and pizza and the dota conversations with people who know more anyways
[12:27 PM] A Random Badger: at least hopefully i can move on to starcraft and meet new people
[12:27 PM] A Random Badger: hopefully
[12:27 PM] A Random Badger: but doubtfully
[12:28 PM] fancy: she and pizza
[12:28 PM] fancy: don't talk
[12:28 PM] fancy: why do you keep bringing him up
[12:30 PM] fancy: like if you have to hate her to get over it then so be it(edited)
[12:30 PM] A Random Badger: idk i figured he was involved in those conversations to
[12:30 PM] A Random Badger: but ig not
[12:30 PM] fancy: but realize that's a choice you're making
[12:30 PM] A Random Badger: i mean she clearly has no respect or concern for me
[12:31 PM] fancy: false
[12:31 PM] A Random Badger: shes not a friend
[12:31 PM] A Random Badger: anymore
[12:31 PM] A Random Badger: ig
[12:31 PM] fancy: badger do you remember when I mentioned
[12:31 PM] fancy: as did pizza
[12:31 PM] fancy: that you don't really treat people like friends
[12:31 PM] A Random Badger: havent i imporved on that
[12:31 PM] A Random Badger: ?
[12:31 PM] A Random Badger: i thought i did
[12:31 PM] A Random Badger: bt ig not
[12:31 PM] A Random Badger: oh well
[12:31 PM] A Random Badger: who needs friends
[12:31 PM] fancy: well
[12:32 PM] fancy: it's more complicated than that
[12:32 PM] fancy: and you need to understand I'm not the norm for patience
[12:32 PM] fancy: nor is pizza
[12:33 PM] fancy: and I'm only patient as I am because I can understand what it's like to be in your position
[12:33 PM] fancy: like you're doing better but it's a long road
[12:33 PM] fancy: and that doesn't undo the past instantly
[12:33 PM] fancy: and you also have to understand she is a type that has little patience for immaturity
[12:34 PM] fancy: and then on top of that she's sick and stuck in an unhappy situation(edited)
[12:34 PM] fancy: she needs extra compassion and consideration
[12:35 PM] A Random Badger: and ive given her that more than anyone else but oh well
[12:36 PM] A Random Badger: cause ive not gotta anything in return
[12:36 PM] A Random Badger: no respect, no consideration, no benefit of the doubt, im just a nuisance apparently
[12:36 PM] A Random Badger: so why deal with it
[12:36 PM] A Random Badger: she has other people
[12:36 PM] A Random Badger: as much as shes like to say she doesnt
[12:37 PM] A Random Badger: she can replace me easily especially in consideration that i wasnt much of a role anyways apparently
[12:37 PM] A Random Badger: who needs me
[12:37 PM] fancy: badger
[12:37 PM] fancy: holy fucking shh
[12:37 PM] A Random Badger: i gotta go get chickens and stuff done
[12:37 PM] A Random Badger: ill be back
[12:37 PM] fancy: how can you talk about someone like that
[12:37 PM] fancy: how much do you have to hate someone
[12:37 PM] fancy: jfc
[12:38 PM] A Random Badger: thats not hate
[12:38 PM] A Random Badger: thats dissapointment
[12:38 PM] A Random Badger: disappointment*
[12:38 PM] fancy: no
[12:38 PM] fancy: you're wrong
[12:38 PM] fancy: that's hate.
[12:38 PM] fancy: pure and simple
[12:39 PM] A Random Badger: what did i say that can be portrayed as hate?
[12:39 PM] A Random Badger: "and ive given her that more than anyone else but oh well"
[12:39 PM] A Random Badger: by this i mean i gave her more than i gave anyone else, not as in i gave her more than anyone else gave her if thats what you took it as
[12:40 PM] A Random Badger: that i claimed she has other people and she doesnt need me?
[12:40 PM] A Random Badger: i beleive that especially if she never considered me much of anything to begin with
[12:41 PM] A Random Badger: that ive gotten nothing in return?
[12:41 PM] A Random Badger: yea i might be wrong about that
[12:41 PM] A Random Badger: what she has given be couldve been genuine
[12:42 PM] A Random Badger: or my doubts could be correct and shes just overly sympathetic for me cause im a nuisance to her.
[12:42 PM] A Random Badger: either is a strong possibility in my eyes
[12:42 PM] A Random Badger: if im not a friend to her and shes not a friend to me, she like the case with dota
[12:42 PM] A Random Badger: why try to force it
[12:42 PM] A Random Badger: when its not right
[12:43 PM] A Random Badger: apparently
[12:43 PM] A Random Badger: okay now i go do chores
[12:43 PM] A Random Badger: i be back
[12:50 PM] fancy: what the fuck do you expect in return
[12:50 PM] fancy: it's not a fucking economy
[12:50 PM] fancy: she doesn't have fucking people badger
[12:51 PM] fancy: her mom fucking doesn't take care of her
[12:51 PM] fancy: she has like 4 fucking friends
[12:51 PM] fancy: she's fucking dying
[12:51 PM] fancy: if anyone deserves fucking charity it's her
[12:51 PM] fancy: she has fucking nothing
[12:51 PM] fancy: being her friend isn't fucking easy
[12:51 PM] fancy: it's fucking work
[12:52 PM] fancy: she's not a fucking vending machine you put coins in and get love out
[12:52 PM] A Random Badger: but i cant force myself into the picture if she doesnt want me there
[12:52 PM] A Random Badger: thats all im concerned about
[12:53 PM] A Random Badger: if im not the right one to be that #4 or #5 friend whichever i am then so be it
[12:54 PM] fancy: I need to take a walk before I say something I regret
[1:06 PM] A Random Badger: i am back
[1:06 PM] A Random Badger: i mean just say it
[1:06 PM] A Random Badger: doesnt help me none when people hold shit in
[1:06 PM] A Random Badger: that only increases my doubt about people
[1:13 PM] fancy: people can be coloured by emotion in the moment
[1:14 PM] fancy: I am quite upset.
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: over what
[1:15 PM] fancy: At you
[1:15 PM] A Random Badger: for what
[1:16 PM] fancy: don't
[1:16 PM] fancy: prod me
[1:16 PM] fancy: I already said
[1:16 PM] fancy: I need a while
[1:16 PM] A Random Badger: you just said you needed a walk but if you need a while longer than fine
[1:17 PM] A Random Badger: just be straight with me when you do say something is all i ask
[1:18 PM] fancy: do I usually mince words.
[1:18 PM] A Random Badger: i understand she needs charity and friends but if all im doing is harming the whole thing then i shouldnt be in the picture is all im saying
[1:18 PM] A Random Badger: i just mean that in response to you not wanting to say something you'll regret
