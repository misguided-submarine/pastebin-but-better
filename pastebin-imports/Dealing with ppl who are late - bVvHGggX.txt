10:30 PM - A Random Badger: no because i wanted to be playing something
10:30 PM - A Random Badger: xd
10:31 PM - fnc: O O F
10:31 PM - A Random Badger: i wanted my irl friends to be online who said they would be soon so i could play fun games with them but they have not shown up
10:31 PM - fnc: when is your birthday
10:31 PM - A Random Badger: i have no birthday ty
10:31 PM - fnc: oh I remember
10:31 PM - A Random Badger: nope
10:31 PM - fnc: I'm buying you a dictionary
10:31 PM - A Random Badger: oh
10:31 PM - A Random Badger: ok
10:31 PM - fnc: and I'm highlighting
10:31 PM - fnc: the word
10:31 PM - fnc: insanity
10:32 PM - A Random Badger: yes
10:32 PM - A Random Badger: i am currently
10:32 PM - A Random Badger: insance
10:32 PM - A Random Badger: insane
10:32 PM - A Random Badger: insance
10:32 PM - fnc: u should consider
10:32 PM - A Random Badger: hm
10:32 PM - fnc: trying other things
10:32 PM - fnc: when the things you are trying
10:32 PM - fnc: always end up with the same result
10:32 PM - A Random Badger: wym
10:32 PM - fnc: just a thought
10:32 PM - fnc: okay so
10:32 PM - fnc: if you always do
10:32 PM - fnc: X thing
10:32 PM - fnc: and Y always happens
10:32 PM - fnc: but you don't like Y
10:32 PM - fnc: how many more times do you think you should do X
10:33 PM - A Random Badger: is this related to my picking game crisis?
10:33 PM - A Random Badger: and the answer is maybe once
10:33 PM - A Random Badger: but probably 0
10:34 PM - A Random Badger: but okay so how does this tie into this
10:34 PM - A Random Badger: im trying to think and it is not registering
10:34 PM - A Random Badger: brain is confused cause it has already melted like
10:34 PM - A Random Badger: an hour ago
10:34 PM - fnc: it's kinda related to most of your life
10:34 PM - A Random Badger: that makes it
10:35 PM - A Random Badger: even more difficult
10:35 PM - A Random Badger: @.@
10:35 PM - fnc: so
10:35 PM - fnc: you routinely engage
10:35 PM - fnc: in the same patterns of behaviour
10:35 PM - fnc: and you routinely get the same results
10:35 PM - fnc: and somehow you think that one day it will change
10:35 PM - fnc: or something
10:36 PM - A Random Badger: you mean the pattern where i sit here and wait for friends to come on and when they never come i sit here and do nothing and get upset
10:36 PM - fnc: that is one pattern
10:36 PM - A Random Badger: so what else is option
10:36 PM - A Random Badger: lets solve this one
10:36 PM - A Random Badger: pls
10:36 PM - fnc: use your time that you're waiting
10:36 PM - fnc: install black ops
10:36 PM - fnc: learn to knit sweaters
10:36 PM - fnc: play pad
10:37 PM - fnc: watch bsj coaching sessions on youtube
10:37 PM - fnc: read wikipedia articles so you learn about things
10:38 PM - fnc: look at it this way
10:38 PM - A Random Badger: my problem is i feel like i need to use it to play something before i have to go to bed and go to work again so i dont want to do something that doesnt involve playing something and i have been watching like go things and other random youtube educational silly things but i come back to the "i want to play something"
10:38 PM - fnc: okay so what you do
10:38 PM - fnc: is you play something
10:38 PM - fnc: and if they show up
10:38 PM - fnc: you can stop playing it
10:38 PM - fnc: and paly something else
10:38 PM - fnc: but here
10:38 PM - fnc: let's look at it another way
10:38 PM - fnc: in life
10:39 PM - fnc: there are factors you can control, and factors you cannot control, yes?
10:39 PM - A Random Badger: yes
10:39 PM - fnc: your friends showing up would be considered something you cannot control
10:39 PM - fnc: correct?
10:39 PM - A Random Badger: yes
10:39 PM - fnc: okay so
10:39 PM - fnc: let's analyze the ways a potential evening can play out
10:39 PM - fnc: Line 1:
10:40 PM - fnc: friends say they're going to show up at some arbitrary time, you think, "hey that's neat, we will be able to play games and have nice memes", you then proceed to sit in discord waiting for them to show up while wandering from youtube video to texting them that they have no concept of time to reading random articles on r/dota2
10:41 PM - fnc: at the end of the night
10:41 PM - fnc: they eventually don't show up and they think nothing of it, and you're just upset because you had planned for them to be there and you had no plan for if they didn't show up, despite it being perfectly reasonable for you to know that they might not
10:43 PM - fnc: Line 2:
10:43 PM - fnc: friends say they're going to show up at some arbitrary time, you think, "hey that's neat, we will be able to play games and have nice memes", you then proceed to sit in discord waiting for them to show up while wandering from youtube video to texting them that they have no concept of time to reading random articles on r/dota2
10:43 PM - fnc: at the middle of the night, they eventually show up
10:43 PM - fnc: and you play games and have nice memes
10:44 PM - fnc: but you preceded it with a period of being grumpy waiting for people, so your mood is worse and you probably have less patience for them when they do get here, so there is a higher chance that there is conflict
10:44 PM - fnc: Line 3:
10:44 PM - fnc: friends say they're going to show up at some arbitrary time, you think, "hey that's neat, we will be able to play games and have nice memes", everyone shows up on time and fun times and nice memes are had
10:44 PM - fnc: Line 4:
10:44 PM - fnc: friends say they're going to show up at some arbitrary time, you think, "hey that's neat, we will be able to play games and have nice memes"
10:45 PM - fnc: However, since you have been through this before, and you have the common sense to realize that people are generally not super punctual especially when it's a casual, non-commital scenario, you decide to have something else to do so you aren't really waiting for them
10:46 PM - fnc: and then if they show up, that's great, you can play, but if they dont' show up, then hey, at least we accomplished something, whether it was productive, or just watching 3 episodes of anime and eating popcorn, or something else, whatever it is
10:46 PM - fnc: so this is generally the only 4 ways this night will go
10:46 PM - fnc: 3 never happens
10:46 PM - fnc: so we pretend it doesn't exist
10:48 PM - fnc: in any scenario, the only things you can control are your expectations/plan for the evening
10:48 PM - fnc: would it not make sense to say that, in Lines 1 and 2, you are essentially choosing to set yourself up for disappointment some percentage of time
10:48 PM - fnc: because of how you are putting all of your eggs in the "friends will show up and until then I will do nothing" basket
10:49 PM - fnc: and how in Line 3, you are avoiding this situation by choosing to set yourself up for maximum possible chance of a good outcome
