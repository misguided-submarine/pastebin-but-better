[8:24 PM] A Random Badger: im still kinda lowkey really disappointed in a way with the whole bani thing
[8:25 PM] fancy: why
[8:25 PM] A Random Badger: wouldnt say upset tho, its kinda w.e to me
[8:25 PM] A Random Badger: because out of everyone in the group ive been kinda the only one keeping up with her since your falling out
[8:25 PM] A Random Badger: and letting her vent to me and what not
[8:26 PM] A Random Badger: and giving each other advice where fit
[8:26 PM] A Random Badger: and all of a sudden she breaks up with jeff which has been the source of all the problems
[8:26 PM] A Random Badger: and she suddenly starts talking to you again
[8:26 PM] A Random Badger: but never thinks to message or talk to me about it?
[8:26 PM] fancy: because I unfriended her over jeff
[8:26 PM] A Random Badger: idk kinda disappointing
[8:27 PM] fancy: it wasn't a falling out
[8:27 PM] fancy: i wasn't mad at her
[8:27 PM] fancy: I don't think she was mad at me
[8:27 PM] fancy: Also I think pizza has been talking to her
[8:28 PM] A Random Badger: no but she definitely kinda felt like you hated her for it in her mind
[8:28 PM] A Random Badger: for a while at least
[8:28 PM] A Random Badger: idk its w.e
[8:28 PM] A Random Badger: i think ill stop talking to her
[8:28 PM] A Random Badger: if i have to be the one to initiate all the time after everything
[8:28 PM] A Random Badger: seems like a one sided relationship
[8:29 PM] A Random Badger: i'd rather not have perhaps
[8:29 PM] fancy: you're a strange person
[8:29 PM] A Random Badger: how is that strange
[8:29 PM] A Random Badger: it's clearly a one sided relationship
[8:29 PM] fancy: I don't know if I trust your perceptions lol
[8:30 PM] fancy: to be frank
[8:30 PM] A Random Badger: i mean i could paste bin all of our conversations over the past year
[8:30 PM] A Random Badger: and its involved me messaging her every month ish to catch up
[8:30 PM] A Random Badger: and talk about shit
[8:30 PM] A Random Badger: and vent
[8:30 PM] A Random Badger: and she's never initiated once
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: and if there was ever a reason to initiate a conversation
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: over the past year
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: i'd think this particular series of events
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: would be it
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: even if just
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: "me and fancy have reconciled"
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: like i dont think thats too much to expect
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: from a friend
[8:31 PM] A Random Badger: who says they appreciate you keeping up with them regularly
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: am i wrong?
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: despite your mistrust of my perception
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: treat it as a hypothetical
[8:32 PM] A Random Badger: am i wrong?
[8:32 PM] fancy: I mean kinda
[8:32 PM] fancy: I don't update you on all my relationships with everyone I know and we are still friends
[8:33 PM] A Random Badger: but we talk regularly
[8:33 PM] A Random Badger: and we share initiating conversations
[8:33 PM] A Random Badger: its not one sided in any sense
[8:33 PM] fancy: ish
[8:33 PM] fancy: depends
[8:33 PM] fancy: it has been in the past
[8:33 PM] A Random Badger: yea when we've had arguments and disagreements
[8:33 PM] A Random Badger: and i get upset
[8:33 PM] A Random Badger: and i feel like im not welcomed
[8:33 PM] A Random Badger: unreasonably so
[8:34 PM] A Random Badger: but
[8:34 PM] A Random Badger: i have
[8:34 PM] A Random Badger: and we reconcile
[8:34 PM] A Random Badger: and everything is better
[8:34 PM] A Random Badger: and we keep talking and being friends and playing games
[8:34 PM] A Random Badger: usually you initiate to play games
[8:34 PM] fancy: except I have to bully u into playing my games cus u like to abandon me
[8:34 PM] fancy: xd
[8:35 PM] A Random Badger: and occasionally ill initiate for more serious conversations
[8:35 PM] A Random Badger: because i respect your intelligence the most
[8:35 PM] A Random Badger: yes lmao
[8:35 PM] A Random Badger: you get where im coming from now tho?
[8:35 PM] fancy: I wouldn't worry about it too much
[8:35 PM] A Random Badger: because otherwise, the only thing i can think of is that my perception of the entire relationship is flawed
[8:35 PM] fancy: I think
[8:36 PM] A Random Badger: and we weren't that good of friends
[8:36 PM] fancy: you should stop worrying about labels
[8:36 PM] fancy: and just live
[8:36 PM] A Random Badger: labels?
[8:36 PM] fancy: yeah
[8:36 PM] A Random Badger: how do those apply here?
8:36 PM] fancy: like
[8:36 PM] fancy: it doesn't matter if you and her are good friends or not
[8:36 PM] fancy: or just okay friends
[8:36 PM] fancy: or whatever
[8:36 PM] fancy: bani isn't really a very sharing type anyway
[8:37 PM] fancy: I usually have to pry things out of her
[8:37 PM] A Random Badger: how did you guys reconnect then
[8:37 PM] fancy: she added me and said she broke up with Jeff
[8:37 PM] A Random Badger: because im assuming she readded you and told you abuot jeff
[8:37 PM] A Random Badger: yea
[8:37 PM] fancy: because the reason I removed her is because I told her
[8:38 PM] fancy: not to add me until it was over
[8:38 PM] A Random Badger: well then what do you recommend i do
[8:39 PM] fancy: what do you mean
[8:39 PM] fancy: what is there to do something about?
[8:39 PM] A Random Badger: keep just having these seemingly one sided interactions that solely reside to my responsibility of have to initiate contact every time? or leave her be until she attempts to actually reciprocate
[8:40 PM] fancy: so here is my philosophy
[8:40 PM] fancy: I talk to people when I want to talk to them
[8:40 PM] fancy: and I don't when I don't
[8:40 PM] fancy: do you want to talk to bani
[8:41 PM] A Random Badger: its entirely dependent on if they want to talk to me and im left feeling like she doesnt, thats the point
[8:41 PM] fancy: nope
[8:41 PM] fancy: bad
[8:41 PM] fancy: bad philosophy
[8:41 PM] fancy: I talk to people that I enjoy talking to
[8:41 PM] fancy: i don't make it at all dependent on them
[8:41 PM] fancy: If you enjoy talking to bani then you talk to bani
[8:41 PM] fancy: if you don't then you don't
[8:42 PM] fancy: do away with the bullshit complications of
[8:42 PM] fancy: "well I'll only enjoy it if she enjoys it" - no, that's BS
[8:42 PM] A Random Badger: thats not what i mean
[8:42 PM] fancy: learn to not consider those
[8:42 PM] fancy: what do you mean then lol
[8:43 PM] A Random Badger: im saying i dont think im going to enjoy talking to her anymore now that i feel like the relationship is entirely dependent on me to initiate conversations and thus she couldnt care less to talk to me
[8:43 PM] fancy: okay so that's
[8:43 PM] A Random Badger: before this yes its as simple as i enjoy talking to her
[8:43 PM] fancy: what I just said
[8:43 PM] A Random Badger: but not i dont think i will
[8:43 PM] fancy: you're complicating it with some bullshit
[8:43 PM] A Random Badger: now*
[8:44 PM] A Random Badger: i dont understand how it is bs tho
[8:44 PM] fancy: because it has nothing to do with the actual conversation
[8:44 PM] fancy: here
[8:44 PM] fancy: an analogy
[8:44 PM] fancy: do you enjoy cooking dinner
[8:44 PM] A Random Badger: yea sure
[8:44 PM] A Random Badger: tho i dont like this analogy already
[8:45 PM] fancy: but dinner never reciprocates
[8:45 PM] A Random Badger: only because it's seemingly focusing on the interactions of a sole character where relationships require 2
[8:45 PM] fancy: it never initiated
[8:45 PM] fancy: it's just something you do
[8:45 PM] A Random Badger: yes but it doesnt have the ability to
[8:46 PM] A Random Badger: because it's inanimate
[8:46 PM] fancy: does that matter
[8:46 PM] A Random Badger: well yea if we're comparing to a relationship between to people
[8:46 PM] A Random Badger: i think
[8:46 PM] A Random Badger: if i were talking to a rock
[8:46 PM] A Random Badger: then sure
[8:46 PM] A Random Badger: i could see the similarities
[8:46 PM] A Random Badger: unless we're saying bani is a rock
[8:47 PM] fancy: no
[8:47 PM] fancy: so
[8:47 PM] fancy: why
[8:47 PM] fancy: does it matter
[8:47 PM] fancy: as far as you are concerned
[8:47 PM] fancy: what's the difference between
[8:47 PM] fancy: a person
[8:47 PM] fancy: and a meal
[8:48 PM] A Random Badger: because another person would have plenty of opportunities to initiate activity with another person, it's only entirely dependent on their intention and interest to do so
[8:48 PM] A Random Badger: where a meal has no choice and no will
[8:48 PM] fancy: stop
[8:48 PM] fancy: is that important
[8:48 PM] fancy: why is it important that something "can" do something
[8:48 PM] fancy: if a meal could intitiate the cooking process, would you expect it to?
[8:49 PM] fancy: would you forego something you enjoyed because of some principle that says "everything must be equal"
[8:49 PM] A Random Badger: yes if that meal enjoyed being eaten otherwise it might never be eaten
[8:49 PM] fancy: so can you see how you're kinda artificially limiting yourself because of this notion of what something "ought" to do
[8:50 PM] A Random Badger: but i could find other meals that are willing to reciprocate the roles in the relationship
[8:50 PM] fancy: what does that really change
[8:50 PM] fancy: objectively
[8:50 PM] A Random Badger: i might find a better meal that finds just as much enjoyment and interest in being eaten by me as i do eating it
[8:51 PM] A Random Badger: because it becomes less enjoyable to eat something that doesnt really care whether it's eaten or not
[8:51 PM] fancy: why
[8:51 PM] fancy: what changes about it
[8:51 PM] fancy: what changes about the meal because it doesn't care about whether you eat it
[8:51 PM] A Random Badger: it's interest in me as a person
[8:52 PM] A Random Badger: it's enjoyment
[8:52 PM] A Random Badger: it's respect of the relationship dynamic
[8:52 PM] A Random Badger: things that are you able to sense about that meal that may negatively or positively impact on your enjoyment of eating it
[8:52 PM] fancy: what does that change about the experience
[8:53 PM] A Random Badger: the enjoyment
[8:53 PM] fancy: does it change the flavour
[8:53 PM] A Random Badger: i mean we can theroritcally say in this analogy that is the impact since meals don't have emotions and cant talk
[8:53 PM] A Random Badger: so sure
[8:53 PM] A Random Badger: comparatively to interactions with people
[8:54 PM] fancy: I mean objectively no it wouldn't change the flavour lol
8:54 PM] A Random Badger: im only making that distinction to make it more fair to the goal of this analogy
[8:54 PM] fancy: the point is
[8:54 PM] fancy: if you stop talking to someone over anything other than the content of the conversations
[8:55 PM] fancy: you're doing yourself a disservice
[8:55 PM] fancy: just because someone else doesn't initiate the conversations doesn't change whether the conversations themselves are enjoyable
[8:56 PM] fancy: if you want something, you are the only person that can make it happen
[8:56 PM] A Random Badger: i dont see that, there's always other people to talk to, people that might be better at having conversations, that might reciprocate interest in those conversations, and thus make the conversation more enjoyable because both parties are actually eager to have them
[8:56 PM] A Random Badger: that's my point
[8:56 PM] A Random Badger: yanno?
[8:56 PM] fancy: no
[8:56 PM] fancy: I don't agree
[8:57 PM] fancy: because all that is based on something you'll never know
[8:57 PM] A Random Badger: so for you it's equally enjoyable to talk to someone who doesnt care and doesnt put effort into a conversation compared to someone who does?
[8:57 PM] fancy: you can never know for sure if I'm actually interested in this conversation right now, or if I'm just humouring you
[8:57 PM] fancy: but that doesn't matter because you should be judging the content of the conversation
[8:58 PM] fancy: yes sometimes one reflects the other
[8:58 PM] fancy: sometimes you can tell
[8:58 PM] fancy: okay this person's side of the conversation and their responses are really low quality
[8:58 PM] fancy: so that means they probably don't care
[8:58 PM] fancy: and sometimes you can't
[8:58 PM] fancy: but whether they care or not isn't important
[8:58 PM] fancy: the conversation itself is what is important
[8:58 PM] fancy: does that make sense
[8:59 PM] A Random Badger: okay but the quality of the person's responses impact the quality of the entire conversation
[8:59 PM] fancy: well yes that is what a conversation is
[8:59 PM] fancy: but whether they care or not doesn't always correspond to the quality of their responses
[9:00 PM] A Random Badger: no but i can make the opposite correlation
[9:00 PM] fancy: no
[9:00 PM] fancy: not always
[9:00 PM] fancy: someone can have shit participation and quality but still care a lot
[9:00 PM] fancy: they could just be bad
[9:00 PM] A Random Badger: so what you're saying is
[9:01 PM] A Random Badger: i should be making my decision of whether or not to keep interaction with someone based on the actual quality of the relationship/converations
[9:01 PM] fancy: yes
[9:01 PM] A Random Badger: and not the potential reasons behind it
[9:01 PM] A Random Badger: ?
[9:01 PM] fancy: yes
[9:01 PM] fancy: don't base things off motive or intentions
[9:01 PM] fancy: unless you have a really good reason to
[9:02 PM] fancy: like a really really good reason
[9:02 PM] fancy: like "I think this person wants to murder me I will not talk to them even tho it's fun"
[9:02 PM] A Random Badger: well i think im still left with the same answer, because the quality of the relationship is really poor :shrug:
[9:02 PM] fancy: yup
[9:02 PM] fancy: bani is not a great conversationalist
[9:03 PM] A Random Badger: i understand what you're trying to say now tho
[9:03 PM] fancy: yeah
[9:03 PM] fancy: I want you to be asking and answering the right questions
[9:03 PM] fancy: and not getting caught up in
[9:03 PM] fancy: weird meta-gamey BS
[9:03 PM] fancy: that everyone else gets caught up in
[9:03 PM] fancy: by overthinking and worrying too much
[9:03 PM] A Random Badger: because a lot of that stuff is hard to prove in the first place
[9:03 PM] fancy: reduce and simplify
[9:03 PM] A Random Badger: yea
[9:03 PM] A Random Badger: well
[9:03 PM] fancy: yup
[9:03 PM] A Random Badger: im done with bani then
[9:04 PM] A Random Badger: ez
[9:04 PM] fancy: yeah just
[9:04 PM] fancy: don't send more messages
[9:04 PM] fancy: and don't feel obligated to respond
[9:04 PM] fancy: ez
[9:04 PM] A Random Badger: yea im not going to
[9:04 PM] A Random Badger: because even if she does initiate, likelihood is quality will still be poor
[9:04 PM] A Random Badger: so no point answering
[9:05 PM] fancy: yeah
[9:05 PM] A Random Badger: gotcha
[9:05 PM] fancy: I mean don't be rude for no reason of course
[9:05 PM] fancy: cus like
[9:05 PM] fancy: why
[9:05 PM] A Random Badger: well yea
[9:05 PM] fancy: but don't feel obligated to carry a conversation
[9:05 PM] fancy: etc
[9:05 PM] fancy: you probably get it
[9:06 PM] A Random Badger: wait so you mean i should respond initially? out of respect/nicety essentially? but just don't make attempt to elongate the interaction?
[9:07 PM] fancy: so like
[9:07 PM] fancy: there's ways to respond to questions or like
[9:07 PM] fancy: attempts to initiate a conversation
[9:08 PM] fancy: that aren't rude but also just defuse it
[9:08 PM] fancy: ya?
[9:08 PM] A Random Badger: yea i know what you mean
[9:08 PM] A Random Badger: so if she initiates like sure go along
[9:08 PM] A Random Badger: don't be rude
[9:08 PM] A Random Badger: but don't keep it going either
[9:08 PM] fancy: basically
[9:08 PM] fancy: don't invest anything into a conversation you find boring basically
[9:08 PM] fancy: but also
[9:08 PM] fancy: in accordance with philosophy number 2
[9:09 PM] fancy: don't burn bridges if you don't have to
