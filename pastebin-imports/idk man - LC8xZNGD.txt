11:44 AM] Brosef: part of what I did was interview a ton of people, and ask them things like "if you had to buy a new washing machine, which of these would you choose" and show like three options, a used one, a new one, and like a super fancy once
[11:45 AM] Brosef: they always picked the used one, but when I asked something like "your mother just called, her dryer is broken and you need to buy her a new one, which one of the following you would buy" and they always always always picked the new option
[11:45 AM] Brosef: didn't matter the situation, always they picked the better options for someone else
[11:45 AM] shin (Shin): people are weird
[11:49 AM] Zianne (Z): Do you think its possible they don't think they are worth the new item? where as they view others as more worthy? or do you think it's a matter of "I can make do with the used one and save the rest" .. But, in gifting one, especially to a loved one, they want better for them?
[11:49 AM] Zianne (Z): or more possibly a combination of both
[11:50 AM] Jade (Vysis): Or a matter of if the situation was reversed, what would they hope to receive. And they think of it that way
[11:50 AM] Zianne (Z): good point
[12:14 PM] Brosef: I think it's a pretty general human trait that those with less are more altruistic
[12:14 PM] Brosef: That kind of thinking really transcends what we consider a cultural norm
[12:18 PM] shin (Shin): Ehh, I think that's more a product of individuals being vastly "better" on their own than as collectives
[12:21 PM] shin (Shin): Generally speaking any given individual tends to be much more generous/compassionate/<insert other positive qualities> compared to when you put the same individuals in a group setting
[12:23 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: On what, exactly, are you basing this assertion?
[12:24 PM] shin (Shin): History and personal experience
[12:26 PM] shin (Shin): If you take a group that's generally regarded in a very negative light, and you talk to an individual that's a member of said group, they tend to be way more reasonable and agreeable than the group disposition would have led you to assume
[12:26 PM] shin (Shin): religious people are a good example
[12:27 PM] shin (Shin): Obviously there are exceptions cus there are definitely group members that are just as distasteful as their groups
[12:27 PM] shin (Shin): but on the whole most people are very agreeable when taken individually
[12:27 PM] Brosef: That's well documented
[12:27 PM] shin (Shin): When you start making decisions as a group it tends to go downhill fast
[12:27 PM] Brosef: It's a part of group dynamics
[12:27 PM] shin (Shin): due to various factors
[12:28 PM] shin (Shin): yeah exactly
[12:28 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: They aren't actually more agreeable.  They're just less likely to show their asshole true selves without their friends around to support their bullshit.
[12:29 PM] Brosef: Not necessarily true
[12:29 PM] shin (Shin): I'd argue that what people do in group settings is less reflective of their own personal beliefs, because it's tainted by the general crippling need of people for acceptance
[12:30 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: Those same people, when the conversation shifts to an anonymous medium, online for example, will revert to their true selves.
[12:30 PM] Brosef: Depends on the group dynamic and who is the anchor of the group, people tend to follow rather than lead, and anchors in any group influence the direction
[12:30 PM] Brosef: Same for online
[12:31 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: Yes, but this need for acceptance can drive people to positivity just as easily as negativity.
[12:31 PM] shin (Shin): And both are equally invalid
[12:31 PM] shin (Shin): imo
[12:32 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: Sure
[12:32 PM] Brosef: What is a true self?  If I constantly have a voice in my head telling me to murder people but never act on it, am I a murderer?
[12:32 PM] shin (Shin): ^^
[12:33 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: But to say that people are more generous or compassionate individually as opposed to in groups isn't necessarily true.  It just depends on the group itself.
[12:34 PM] shin (Shin): It's true because most groups tend to be negative rather than positive
12:31 PM] shin (Shin): And both are equally invalid
[12:31 PM] shin (Shin): imo
[12:32 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: Sure
[12:32 PM] Brosef: What is a true self?  If I constantly have a voice in my head telling me to murder people but never act on it, am I a murderer?
[12:32 PM] shin (Shin): ^^
[12:33 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: But to say that people are more generous or compassionate individually as opposed to in groups isn't necessarily true.  It just depends on the group itself.
[12:34 PM] shin (Shin): It's true because most groups tend to be negative rather than positive
[12:34 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: That's a philosophical question.
[12:35 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: Yeah, well, that's just, like, your opinion, man.
[12:35 PM] Brosef: People exist on a spectrum.   Who they are at any given moment is dependent on their situation and perspective.  I can be incredibly generous and kind, I can also be a massive asshole.  I can be accepting and tolerant but I can also be a huge racist if put in the right environment
[12:35 PM] Brosef:

[12:36 PM] shin (Shin): I don't think I really agree with this
[12:36 PM] shin (Shin): Well
[12:36 PM] shin (Shin): Maybe I might agree that's how most people tend to act
[12:36 PM] shin (Shin): I'd have to think more about what exactly I think about this
[12:37 PM] Brosef:

[12:37 PM] shin (Shin): Personally I don't identify with that description at all
[12:38 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: Situation definitely influences mood, and mood can certainly have massive effects on behavior.  I don't think there's any doubt that this is true, but I think it's only tangentially related to the group dynamic discussion we were having...
[12:38 PM] shin (Shin): I guess maybe if you mean "who they are" as in "what the perception of a person is"
[12:39 PM] shin (Shin): Yeah my thing is just that you're not a different person because you're in a different mood, you're the same person, it's just perhaps a facet of you that is only seen in certain scenarios
[12:39 PM] shin (Shin): who you are is a holistic package
[12:40 PM] Brosef: You are a different person depending on your situation and environment
[12:40 PM] shin (Shin): Yeah I disagree with that
[12:40 PM] Brosef: Would you steal a coat from a store?  Do you believe stealing is wrong?
[12:40 PM] shin (Shin): And I disagree because it removes personal responsibility
[12:40 PM] shin (Shin): to use that phrasing
[12:41 PM] shin (Shin): Depends, and not inherently
[12:41 PM] Brosef: What if you got kicked out of your house and your child was freezing to death, but you had no money.  Would you steal one then?
[12:41 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: Irrelevant. People don't always behave in accordance with their beliefs.
[12:41 PM] Brosef: No but the environment can change a belief
[12:41 PM] shin (Shin): I think they do, it's just that certain beliefs take priority over others by necessity
[12:41 PM] shin (Shin): some things are more fundamental than others
[12:42 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: You can believe that theft is wrong, and still steal a coat.
[12:42 PM] Brosef: And if people don't act in accordance with beliefs, is there a true self?  Or just the self that exists at that time in that situation
[12:42 PM] shin (Shin): In this scenario your belief about theft is being preempted by a different belief
[12:43 PM] shin (Shin): you can't weigh all beliefs identically because you would implode whenever there is a conflict
[12:43 PM] Brosef: "I believe what I must to move forward"
[12:43 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: Its being preempted, but probably by a need, and not a belief.
[12:43 PM] Brosef: That's about the best anyone can ever sum it up
[12:43 PM] shin (Shin): needs stem from beliefs
[12:43 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: No
[12:44 PM] shin (Shin): of course they do
[12:44 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: More likely the other way around
[12:44 PM] Brosef: I'm being called away from philosophy 101 to go back to reality 101
[12:44 PM] Brosef: Sadface
[12:44 PM] shin (Shin): people who believe they deserve to live will act to preserve their life
[12:44 PM] shin (Shin): people who don't believe they deserve to live will not act in the same way
[12:45 PM] shin (Shin): even though in both cases the needs to satisfy life are the same
[12:45 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: People are animals.  They don't have to believe they deserve life in order to try and preserve it.
[12:45 PM] shin (Shin): they absolutely do
[12:46 PM] shin (Shin): there are tons of examples of people that no longer believe they deserve to live and act in destructive ways
[12:46 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: That doesn't disprove what I said.
[12:47 PM] shin (Shin): How so
[12:47 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: Sure, a belief that you don't deserve life can suppress your self preservation instinct.
[12:48 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: But the instinct itself is intrinsic.
[12:48 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: No belief is required to have it.
[12:52 PM] shin (Shin): I feel like we don't agree about what belief means in this scenario
[12:53 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: Maybe.
[1:01 PM] Braendyn Witherwind: When I use the word "belief" I mean "a passive and complete acceptance of something as truth."
