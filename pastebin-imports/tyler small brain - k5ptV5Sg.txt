6:19 AM] Blairin: @NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap you can get anthem for 15 bucks and play today if you pay for origin premier
[6:19 AM] Blairin: but if you ever cancel it you lose the game
[6:24 AM] IUM SIO DFUGFKCIN G MAD: 15 bucks he cant afford that
[6:24 AM] IUM SIO DFUGFKCIN G MAD: he still owes me a jugg arcana
[6:29 AM] Blairin: lmao
[8:53 AM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: why play anthem when i can play apex
[8:53 AM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: the game that outshines anthem
[8:54 AM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: top 1000 mirages btw

[8:54 AM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: :point_right: :ok_hand: :question:
[8:55 AM] Blairin: congrats  you're playing a garbage game that will fade out of style like fortnite in another couple of months
[8:56 AM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: just like anthem will?
[8:56 AM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: :V
[9:02 AM] Blairin: anthem isn't supposed to be a long term multiplayer experience
[9:02 AM] Blairin: you can play anthem solo
[9:02 AM] Blairin: you can't play apex without players
[9:02 AM] Blairin: it's ok that you have terrible taste in games
[9:07 AM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: you can play apex without players
[9:08 AM] Blairin:

[10:16 AM] fancy: @Blairin sorry... facts not allowed
[10:16 AM] fancy: only feelings here
[10:18 AM] fancy: is anthem the one that's like PvE stuff?
[10:18 AM] Blairin: yeah it's like destiny with jetpacks
[10:18 AM] Blairin: looks pretty cool
[10:18 AM] fancy: I think it reminded me of Warframe the first time I saw it
[10:19 AM] Blairin: but tyler >look i'm no-lifeing this game now
[10:19 AM] Blairin: >why aren't you guys playing, i only no-lifed this game for 200 hours now
[10:19 AM] fancy: battle royale games xd
[10:19 AM] fancy: good concept I promise
[10:20 AM] fancy: I never understood the attraction of those kind of games, they always felt really... cheap I guess
[10:22 AM] fancy: anthem seems interesting except for how much I don't want to install origin
[1:00 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: no lifeing aka playing the occasional match or two every other day when nikki goes to bed or is busy
[1:00 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: omega
[1:01 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: I have like less than 30 hours I’d say or less
[1:02 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: I just am comparatively looking at stats and the longevity of anthem doesn’t look promising if it’s being outshined and blown out of the water by an unannounced free to play game
[1:03 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: But I guess we’ll see the results soon enough
[1:03 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: :StupidPao:
[1:06 PM] Blairin: >free to play game has more players than paid game
[1:06 PM] Blairin: wow....
[1:07 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: ok but the point is it’s got WAY more players
[1:08 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: of course a f2p game will have more players inherently
[1:08 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: unless the game is really bad like artifact
[1:09 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: but the point is apex has WAY more players than anthem even for being a free to play game over paid game
[1:10 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: apex has better stats than pubg ever did
[1:12 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: It’s hit over 25 million players and climbing
[1:12 PM] Blairin: artifact wasn't f2p
[1:12 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Where’s apex
[1:12 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Compared to anthem
[1:12 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Statistically
[1:12 PM] Blairin: except you're only going to see like 4 people max so the player count doesn't matter
[1:13 PM] Blairin: and tyler, plenty of flies eat shit on a daily basis, that doesn't mean it's good
[1:16 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: This was your statement: congrats  you're playing a garbage game that will fade out of style like fortnite in another couple of months
[1:17 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: I doubt it’ll “fade out in a couple of months”
[1:17 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: And anthem is already faded out omega
[1:17 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: That’s what I’m trying to say
[1:17 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Anthem doesn’t have much going for it compared to apex
[1:17 PM] fancy: isn't anthem not even out yet..?
[1:17 PM] fancy: Also ALSO
[1:17 PM] fancy: aren't they different genres...
[1:18 PM] fancy: why are we comparing them
[1:18 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Yes but they’re games in general
[1:18 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: So you can compare their popularity
[1:18 PM] fancy: okay that's literally the most vacuous perspective on comparing games I've ever heard
[1:19 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: fancy I think you’re just adding ur 10 cents just to add ur 10 cents
[1:19 PM] fancy: no I was talking to blairin earlier
[1:20 PM] fancy: also isn't that literally why anyone ever adds their opinion to a discussion
[1:21 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: @IUM SIO DFUGFKCIN G MAD im ded i got 3 hours of sleep
[1:23 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: @Cunt

[1:38 PM] zacc: no @fancy youre wrong
[1:38 PM] zacc: this wasnt a discussion
[1:38 PM] zacc: it was a public argument
[1:38 PM] fancy: oooooh
[1:38 PM] fancy: my b
[1:38 PM] fancy: ty for clarification @zacc
[1:39 PM] zacc: anytime bud
[1:39 PM] IUM SIO DFUGFKCIN G MAD: @NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap
[1:39 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: @IUM SIO DFUGFKCIN G MAD
[1:39 PM] zacc: @donkey
[1:40 PM] IUM SIO DFUGFKCIN G MAD: :woman::skin-tone-1:‍:school:
[1:40 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: :aiden:
[1:47 PM] Blairin: >anthem isn't out yet
[1:47 PM] Blairin: it's faded
[1:47 PM] Blairin: ah yes
[1:47 PM] fancy: yeah that's what I was asking
[1:48 PM] fancy: but apparently I'm not allowed to ask questions
[1:48 PM] Blairin: i forgot, games are irrelevant
[1:48 PM] fancy: cus it's just me sharing my opinion
[1:48 PM] fancy: or something
[1:48 PM] Blairin: >if ur game isn't released RIGHT NOW it's irrelevant
[1:48 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: i wonder if anthem will even hit 25 million players
[1:49 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Within a couple of months
[1:49 PM] Blairin: and tyler, everyone thought fortnite was going to stay forever, everyone thought pubg would stay forever, everyone thought LoL would stay forever
[1:49 PM] Blairin: apex will fade
[1:49 PM] Blairin: within a few months
[1:49 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Yes it will fade
[1:49 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: But not in months
[1:49 PM] Blairin: yes
[1:49 PM] Blairin: it will
[1:49 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Anthem will fade in months
[1:49 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Ok let’s find out
[1:49 PM] Blairin: >ANTHEM WILL NEVER HIT 25 MIL
[1:49 PM] Blairin: YES RETARD
1:49 PM] fancy: I mean are you asking if a game in a completely different genre than the current FotM is gonna be as popular?
[1:49 PM] Blairin: IT'S A 60 DOLLAR GAME
[1:49 PM] Blairin: LOL
[1:49 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: I’m not arguing the price
[1:49 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: I’m arguing the relevancy
[1:50 PM] fancy: that's a nice buzzword
[1:51 PM] fancy: idk what you even mean by relevancy
[1:51 PM] fancy: like no it's probably not going to have the same player base as games like apex because it's not the same kind of game....
[1:52 PM] fancy: like it's not going after the same market
[1:52 PM] fancy: it's like comparing tractors to luxury sedans cus they're both cars
[1:52 PM] fancy: well
[1:52 PM] fancy: vehicles I guess technically
[1:53 PM] fancy: very different target markets
[1:56 PM] IUM SIO DFUGFKCIN G MAD: @NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap Football is out shining apex
[1:56 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Yes
[1:56 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: It is
[1:56 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Is football a video game or are you talking about real football
[1:57 PM] IUM SIO DFUGFKCIN G MAD: @NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap Eating and breathing is outshining apex and football combined
[1:57 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Because anthem and apex are the same devs same release times
[1:57 PM] Blairin: ok
[1:57 PM] Blairin: fifa 2019 is outshining apex
[1:57 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: It’s not tho
[1:57 PM] Blairin: it actually is
[1:57 PM] fancy: guys mobile games are crushing pc games
[1:57 PM] Blairin: you have to be a buffoon to think it isn't
[1:57 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Proof?
[1:57 PM] Blairin: ok
[1:57 PM] IUM SIO DFUGFKCIN G MAD: Instagram is outshining apex
[1:58 PM] Blairin: oh right i mean fifa 2018, 19 isn't out yet
[1:58 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Are instagram and apex elated
[1:58 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Related
[1:58 PM] Blairin: FIFA 18, has sold over 24 million copies globally
[1:58 PM] IUM SIO DFUGFKCIN G MAD: Are apex and anthem
[1:58 PM] fancy: are apex and clash of clans related
[1:58 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Yes they are nikki
[1:58 PM] fancy: how lol
[1:58 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Both games by EA
[1:58 PM] IUM SIO DFUGFKCIN G MAD: Instagram is too
[1:58 PM] Blairin: so are fifa, fifa is EA
[1:58 PM] Blairin: :)
[1:58 PM] IUM SIO DFUGFKCIN G MAD: they’re both entertainment
[1:58 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Did Instagram make apex
[1:59 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: ?
[1:59 PM] fancy: wait Tyler why do you think apex and anthem are the same because they have the same dev
[1:59 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Instagram developers*
[1:59 PM] fancy: like do you legitimately believe that
[1:59 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: They’re not the same but they’re both video games by the same developers
[1:59 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Both relevant right now
[1:59 PM] IUM SIO DFUGFKCIN G MAD: EA is very big i doubt u have the same developers on different projects
[1:59 PM] fancy: okay but can you understand that they might be very different games with very different target markets
[2:00 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Yes
[2:00 PM] fancy: just like ea also develops fifa
[2:00 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: I never argued that
[2:00 PM] fancy: and it doesn't make very much sense to compare fifa to apex to anthem
[2:00 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: I never did
2:00 PM] fancy: since they're not targeting the same market
[2:00 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: If you go back
[2:00 PM] fancy: yes you did you're the one that brought anthem up originally
[2:00 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: The thing I originally said
[2:00 PM] IUM SIO DFUGFKCIN G MAD: :woman::skin-tone-1:‍:airplane:️
[2:00 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Was apex is outshining anthem
[2:01 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: That’s not my opinion
[2:01 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: That’s fact
[2:01 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Am I wrong
[2:01 PM] fancy: what does that mean
[2:01 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: I don’t care if they’re different genres
[2:01 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: I just stated a fact
[2:01 PM] fancy: because that fact is vacuous
[2:01 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: That apex is outshining anthem
[2:01 PM] fancy: that's why it doesn't matter
[2:02 PM] fancy: unless you're trying to do some business perspective analysis
[2:02 PM] fancy: of how you're going to allocate your payroll and r/d budgets for next year
[2:02 PM] fancy: have you heard of confounding variables
[2:02 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Ok so if comparing them doesn’t matter
[2:02 PM] Rezalb: Blairin just remember all fifa games are the same
[2:02 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Then why does everyone care so much
[2:02 PM] Rezalb: And they still outshine apex
[2:02 PM] fancy: battle Royale games in general outshine whatever the fuck genre anthem is in general
[2:02 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Yes
[2:03 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: You’re not wrong
[2:03 PM] Rezalb: @Blairin
[2:03 PM] fancy: in terms of revenue and player base
[2:03 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: I never said otherwise
[2:03 PM] fancy: it has nothing to do with the games themselves
[2:03 PM] fancy: does that make sense to you?
[2:03 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: It somewhat does though
[2:03 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: There’s tetris battle royale
[2:03 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: It didn’t hit 20 million players
[2:03 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: And it’s a battle royale
[2:04 PM] Blairin: if we're comparing battle royales...
[2:04 PM] Blairin: fortnite still has more
[2:04 PM] Blairin: after all this
[2:04 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: There’s that shitty game that got removed that was a battle royale
[2:04 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: It has more players yes
[2:04 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: But less relevancy
[2:04 PM] Blairin: also you can't possibly say apex is outshining anthem
[2:04 PM] Blairin: before fucking release
[2:04 PM] Blairin: LMAO
[2:04 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: It’s got a quarter of viewers on twitch or something like that
[2:05 PM] Blairin: IT'S NOT RELEASED
[2:05 PM] fancy: okay so the way that you'd compare the relative success of either of these two games is by comparing them to the average for their target markets
[2:05 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Oh boy back to anthem
[2:05 PM] Blairin: tyler actually can't admit he's wrong but what's new
[2:05 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap:

[2:05 PM] fancy: not by doing an absolute comparison
[2:05 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: what am I wrong about
[2:05 PM] fancy: I don't think he is actually understanding this concept
[2:05 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Saying apex is outshining anthem?
[2:05 PM] Blairin: >comparing paid to free
[2:05 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: What
[2:06 PM] Blairin: >comparing rpg to br
[2:06 PM] fancy: tyler do you understand that that is a vacuous statement
[2:06 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: That’s not me being wrong
[2:06 PM] Blairin: IT IS
[2:06 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: :sob::ok_hand:
[2:06 PM] fancy: I'll take that as a no
[2:08 PM] fancy: let's all pick  up clash of clans since it outshines literally every other game in the world
[2:08 PM] fancy: @Blairin
[2:08 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: I already have that
[2:09 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: I’ll add u
[2:09 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: To my clan
[2:09 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: Would you like to play clash royale too ?
[2:09 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: It’s a bit more fun than coc imo
[2:09 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: I can add u to my clan there too
[2:09 PM] NIKKI IS MY WAIFU AYAYA Clap: @fancy @Blairin
