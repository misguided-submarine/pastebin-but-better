[3:14 PM] Suck it, Moto!: The you pretending to be "the only adult" is getting pretty cringey tbh
[3:23 PM] fancy: I'm glad
[3:23 PM] fancy: for you
[3:24 PM] A Random Badger: so i have to babysit my brother for an hour
[3:24 PM] A Random Badger: and im going to attempt to see if a 5 year old can learn how to play skyrim
andrew1
[3:25 PM] fancy: you want a list of things that are cringe ?
[3:28 PM] fancy: regardless of how cringe it is because I exaggerate things to an extreme, the underlying problem still exists
[3:29 PM] Suck it, Moto!: which is?
[3:34 PM] fancy: you guys act like children severely and often when we play
[3:34 PM] fancy: and it makes it an unpleasant experience for me
[3:34 PM] fancy: and I'm kinda tired of putting up with it
[3:36 PM] Suck it, Moto!: you freak out and complain too
[3:37 PM] Suck it, Moto!: just last night you dc'd from the discord vc during a dota game
[3:37 PM] fancy: I feel like playing with you, I have to  walk on eggshells
[3:37 PM] fancy: I left because Gabe fucking accused me of not trying
[3:37 PM] fancy: that's some fucking nerve
[3:38 PM] fancy: I don't need or want to deal with that
[3:38 PM] Suck it, Moto!: it doesnt matter what gabe did leaving and pouting about it is pretty childish
[3:38 PM] Suck it, Moto!: You and I haven't even played anything besides ratz in weeks
[3:39 PM] fancy: I wasn't pouring
[3:39 PM] fancy: pouting
[3:39 PM] fancy: I went to talk to people that don't piss me off like that
[3:39 PM] fancy: and yeah last time we played ratz you tilted
[3:40 PM] fancy: it's been a long process of me getting fed up
[3:41 PM] fancy: badger there better be periods in this
[3:41 PM] fancy: and paragraphs
[3:41 PM] A Random Badger: yes but you also kinda severly overestimate the competitive nature of pubs, when people play pubs, especially msot of us children, we play for the fun and to goof off, and the people we play against will a majority of the time have the same mentality, so whats the point being up tight all the time, it's different when you play in ranked, i can try hard in soloq or party ranked, but thats not what we're queueing for lol and regarding the gabe incident because i was watching the stream for that entire game, i cant really blame him, because you did very frequently give off that you were clearly annoyed and up tight and not having fun and said stupid petty stuff like "gg this is a loss" or w.e several times like if you're not having fun with the game thats fine, but you got jebaited into an arguement because you said something petty because you were annoyed and your mentality was clouded, personally, i think you need to just learn to relax and have fun in pubs with us, because even the people we play against are not playing nearly as competitive as you're trying to, you can still win games by fooling around, but if only want to try hard and play competitively with and against people who are equally playing competitively that play ranked
[3:41 PM] A Random Badger: no
[3:42 PM] fancy: oh god
[3:43 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I dont particulary recall tilting in ratz last time. Sure I bet I complained that I dont have the mechanics down and was critical of myself for that but that isn't childish.
[3:45 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I was listening for some of that game, most of the midgame and Badger is right you kept saying "we lsot" and claiming their heroes were unkillable and that the game wasn't salvage-able. Gabe was not wrong we he said you appeared to had given up.
[3:46 PM] fancy: please format this
[3:46 PM] fancy: badger
[3:47 PM] Suck it, Moto!: just fucking read it dude
[3:47 PM] Suck it, Moto!: lol
[3:47 PM] A Random Badger: it is not hard to understand
[3:47 PM] fancy: it is
[3:47 PM] fancy: I can't read blocks
[3:48 PM] A Random Badger: then ill copy and paste the sentences into different segments for you to understand
[3:48 PM] fancy: yes
[3:48 PM] fancy: paragraphs
[3:48 PM] Suck it, Moto!: and we're the children...

[3:48 PM] A Random Badger: you kinda severly overestimate the competitive nature of pubs, when people play pubs, especially msot of us children, we play for the fun and to goof off
[3:49 PM] A Random Badger: the people we play against will a majority of the time have the same mentality
[3:49 PM] A Random Badger: whats the point being up tight all the time liek you do
[3:49 PM] A Random Badger: it's different when you play in ranked
[3:49 PM] A Random Badger: i can try hard in soloq or party ranked, but thats not what we're queueing for
[3:49 PM] A Random Badger: regarding the gabe incident because i was watching the stream for that entire game, i cant really blame him
[3:50 PM] A Random Badger: you did very frequently give off that you were clearly annoyed and up tight and not having fun and said stupid petty stuff like "gg this is a loss" or w.e several times like if you're not having fun with the game
[3:50 PM] A Random Badger: thats fine, but you got jebaited into an arguement because you said something petty because you were annoyed and your mentality was clouded
[3:50 PM] A Random Badger: personally, i think you need to just learn to relax and have fun in pubs with us
[3:50 PM] A Random Badger: even the people we play against are not playing nearly as competitive as you're trying to
[3:51 PM] A Random Badger: you can still win games by fooling around
[3:51 PM] A Random Badger: if only want to try hard and play competitively with and against people who are equally playing competitively that play ranked
[3:51 PM] A Random Badger: tldr:
[3:51 PM] A Random Badger: loosen up when you play pubs with us
[3:51 PM] Suck it, Moto!: This is literally spoon feeding fancy. "The only adult here"
[3:51 PM] A Random Badger: or
[3:51 PM] A Random Badger: start only queueing up for ranked
[3:51 PM] A Random Badger: and then we'll start playing seriously
[3:52 PM] fancy: really, it's a lot to ask for properly formatted thoughts ?
[3:52 PM] A Random Badger: i cant
[3:52 PM] fancy: so is formatting academic papers spoon feeding ?
[3:52 PM] A Random Badger: im with a very impatient child rn
[3:52 PM] fancy: @Suck it, Moto!
[3:52 PM] fancy: not you badger you're fine
[3:52 PM] A Random Badger: okay
[3:52 PM] A Random Badger: well im gonna show child skyrim now
[3:52 PM] A Random Badger: brb
[3:53 PM] Suck it, Moto!: It's one thing to have a paragraph break every 3/4 of a page, but badger copy paste it sentence by sentence is just laughable
[3:54 PM] Suck it, Moto!: are you on your phone or something?
[3:54 PM] fancy: yeah I'm at work dude
[3:54 PM] fancy: but badger always does the huge block of run on sentences thing
[3:54 PM] fancy: and I can't follow his thought process
[3:54 PM] fancy: neither can Subhanshu
[3:55 PM] fancy: @ the Gabe thing, we've played enough games where he should know I never give up
[3:56 PM] Suck it, Moto!: That's so weird to me. I found it perfectly understandable. It aint gonna win any literature awards but acting like you're too smart to read unformatted text is just silly
[3:56 PM] fancy: I complain aggressively about everything
[3:56 PM] fancy: I wasn't acting smart?
[3:56 PM] fancy: I was saying I have issues reading it?
[3:56 PM] fancy: and I asked politely
[3:56 PM] fancy: so uh
[3:56 PM] fancy: kindly
[3:56 PM] fancy: mind your own business lol
[3:57 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Alright so my business here I guess is addressing your complaint that every time we play games I act childish, correct? And this makes you not want to play anymore?
[3:57 PM] fancy: not every time
[3:57 PM] fancy: but it's severe enough
[3:57 PM] fancy: and often enough
[3:59 PM] fancy: that I feel I need to walk on eggshells
[3:59 PM] fancy: or you'll explode
[3:59 PM] fancy: or Julian will
[3:59 PM] fancy: and ruin the night
[3:59 PM] fancy: and it's no longer worth it to me
[3:59 PM] fancy: tired of feeling like the bad guy
[4:00 PM] Suck it, Moto!: What exactly are you filtering out? Are you witholding criticisms of our gameplay?
[4:01 PM] fancy: what do you mean
[4:01 PM] fancy: I feel like I need to hold back
[4:01 PM] fancy: or not laugh at you
[4:01 PM] fancy: or etc etc
[4:01 PM] fancy: take it easy because you can't handle me being better
[4:01 PM] fancy: and then on top of that you also get mad at the game itself
[4:02 PM] fancy: I've been playing with other people for a while now and they don't make me feel that way
[4:02 PM] fancy: they don't make me feel bad for being good
[4:03 PM] fancy: @A Random Badger saying you shouldn't try because it's unranked is a bad argument
[4:03 PM] fancy: and again like I said, Gabe should know by now that I never give up on a game
[4:03 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I think he's saying you dont have to boil yourself over in unranked
[4:03 PM] fancy: I play to win
[4:03 PM] Suck it, Moto!: But there are no stakes
[4:04 PM] fancy: there's no stakes in ranked either
[4:04 PM] fancy: it's a game
[4:04 PM] Suck it, Moto!: ok so you agree?
[4:04 PM] fancy: the only difference is whether you see your e-peen value
[4:04 PM] fancy: it's a competitive game, the stakes are the same
[4:04 PM] fancy: I play to win
[4:04 PM] fancy: you don't have to play to win
[4:04 PM] fancy: but then I don't want to be a part of that
[4:05 PM] fancy: I don't enjoy getting fucked over by my team constantly because they're a bunch of jokers
[4:05 PM] fancy: if you're bad, sure
[4:05 PM] fancy: I can deal
[4:05 PM] fancy: if you're being a cuck just to annoy me
[4:05 PM] Suck it, Moto!: clearly you cant
[4:05 PM] fancy: fuck right off
[4:05 PM] fancy: I can handle bad people
[4:05 PM] fancy: bani, randy, hope, and Brian are all bad
[4:05 PM] Suck it, Moto!: so am i
[4:05 PM] fancy: and it's not a problem
[4:05 PM] fancy: they don't rage though
[4:05 PM] fancy: ever
[4:05 PM] fancy: they're chill
[4:06 PM] fancy: and they do their best even if their best isn't good(edited)
[4:06 PM] fancy: that's not true of all of us here
[4:06 PM] fancy: I have no issue with you being bad
[4:07 PM] fancy: i have issues with the temper tantrums
[4:07 PM] fancy: and the quitting mid game
[4:07 PM] fancy: and the sulking
[4:07 PM] fancy: and the ruined nights
[4:07 PM] fancy: and feeling like I can't just let loose and have fun
[4:07 PM] Suck it, Moto!: When was the last time I quit anything midgame?
[4:07 PM] fancy: unless I get you all drunk and then I have to deal with that shit
[4:08 PM] fancy: it's happened andrew, and it's happened that you've directly taken shit out on me multiple times
[4:08 PM] fancy: and I don't want to deal with it
[4:08 PM] fancy: it's more pleasant to not
[4:08 PM] fancy: even if it's not guaranteed to happen
[4:08 PM] fancy: patterns are there
[4:08 PM] Suck it, Moto!: The worst I've done is quit between game and yell at you when you refused to understand why I wanted to stop
[4:08 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I apologized to you for that
[4:09 PM] fancy: that doesn't mean it won't happen again
[4:09 PM] Suck it, Moto!: and you hardly acknowledged it
[4:09 PM] fancy: happened before
[4:09 PM] fancy: you apologized
[4:09 PM] fancy: happened again
[4:09 PM] fancy: you consistently get upset because you have the least kills in ratz or csgo
[4:10 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Yeah, being at the bottom every time is not as fun
[4:10 PM] Suck it, Moto!: no one here is gonna pretend that isn't true
[4:10 PM] fancy: and you make me feel bad when I pull a nice shot in ratz
[4:10 PM] fancy: you're like wtf how you weren't even look at me this is stupid
[4:10 PM] fancy: etc
[4:10 PM] fancy: I spent every csgo game
[4:11 PM] fancy: for the first month or so
[4:11 PM] fancy: bottom fragging(edited)
[4:11 PM] fancy: and I wasn't too upset by it
[4:11 PM] fancy: unless Subhanshu disagrees
[4:11 PM] fancy: @Subhanshu
[4:12 PM] Subhanshu: I'm going to pick up my mom i'll read all this later
[4:12 PM] Subhanshu: i haven't read any of it yet
[4:12 PM] fancy: I just need you
[4:12 PM] fancy: for the last question
[4:13 PM] fancy: rn
[4:13 PM] fancy: lol
[4:13 PM] Subhanshu: yes but i want context on the whole conversation
[4:13 PM] fancy: was I particularly upset when I was bad at csgo
[4:13 PM] Subhanshu: and still wanna read it in order lol
[4:13 PM] fancy: in the first month
[4:13 PM] Subhanshu: shh
[4:13 PM] Subhanshu: let me marinate
[4:13 PM] Subhanshu: MARINATION
[4:13 PM] fancy: I roport
[4:13 PM] fancy: gg
[4:13 PM] Subhanshu: i wnt to answer with context too
[4:13 PM] fancy: what kind of sauce
[4:13 PM] fancy: sir
[4:13 PM] Subhanshu: brb in 30 minutes
[4:13 PM] Subhanshu: alfredo
[4:13 PM] fancy: oh
[4:13 PM] fancy: rip
[4:13 PM] fancy: we lsot
[4:14 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I'm a competitive person, and I hate losing . When I do things, I like to be good at them, so that I can win. That makes me feel good. When I lose, I feel bad.
[4:15 PM] Suck it, Moto!: And I feel worse when I lose in situations where I did have the ability to win. Losing bc the other person is just way better and that gap is too wide still sucks, but the real disappoinment comes when you lose primiarily because you perform poorly.
[4:15 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I would not have CSGO installed on my computer If I didnt want to get better at it
[4:16 PM] Suck it, Moto!: it's something I would like to be good at
[4:16 PM] fancy: okay, sure
[4:16 PM] Suck it, Moto!: and no I dont have as much time to put into it as you do Josh.
[4:16 PM] fancy: but that doesn't mean you have to act like a child when you do lose
[4:17 PM] fancy: letting it ruin your whole day
[4:17 PM] fancy: is childish
[4:17 PM] fancy: maybe you hate losing a close game more than getting blown out
[4:17 PM] fancy: and I don't see it that way
[4:17 PM] fancy: but regardless
[4:18 PM] A Random Badger: i dont have time to follow all of this but to respond, im not telling you not to try im telling you to loosen up because being up tight in games all the time where the people you are playing with and against are not playing that seriously is not healthy for YOU
[4:18 PM] A Random Badger: also
[4:18 PM] A Random Badger: i cant really speak for other people
[4:18 PM] A Random Badger: but i personally dont complain in games really
[4:18 PM] fancy: badger I play dota to win not to relax
[4:18 PM] A Random Badger: ill fool around
[4:18 PM] fancy: dota isn't my relaxation
[4:18 PM] A Random Badger: but i wont throw temper tantrums
[4:18 PM] fancy: yeah you don't
[4:18 PM] fancy: you just act like a cuck sometimes to piss me off
[4:18 PM] fancy: whether intentional or not
[4:18 PM] fancy: lol
[4:19 PM] A Random Badger: no i play like a cuck because im trying to get you to loosen up because as i said
[4:19 PM] fancy: that pisses me off
[4:19 PM] fancy: play correctly and I'll loosen up
[4:19 PM] A Random Badger: it's not healthy to be up tight all the time, especially in games where the people you're playing with arent trying as hard as you
[4:19 PM] fancy: I'm not
[4:19 PM] A Random Badger: if you want to try hard and be up tight queue for ranked
[4:19 PM] fancy: I'm only uptight when you're throwing my games
[4:19 PM] A Random Badger: no
[4:19 PM] fancy: ranked is the same as unranked
[4:20 PM] A Random Badger: you are almost
[4:20 PM] A Random Badger: always uptight
[4:20 PM] A Random Badger: unless
[4:20 PM] fancy: badger because you always throw my games
[4:20 PM] A Random Badger: you're playing with people equal to your skill level
[4:20 PM] fancy: I'm not uptight while playing with Randy and Brian and shit
[4:20 PM] A Random Badger: or the people you're playing with are sucking your e-peen because they know you are a good player
[4:20 PM] fancy: haven't really been upight playing with space
[4:21 PM] A Random Badger: like those 'new people' you play wth that you said dont make you feel that way
[4:21 PM] A Random Badger: thats almost entirely because
[4:21 PM] A Random Badger: they know you're good
[4:21 PM] A Random Badger: and they want you to win them games
[4:21 PM] fancy: they know I'm good, and aren't threatened by it
[4:21 PM] A Random Badger: they're sucking your e-penis
[4:21 PM] fancy: and they're chill as fuck
[4:21 PM] fancy: not because they tell me I'm good
[4:21 PM] fancy: I know I'm not good
[4:21 PM] fancy: I don't care if they think I am
[4:21 PM] A Random Badger: when were we ever threatened by your skill?
[4:22 PM] fancy: Andrew and Julian certainly have been
[4:22 PM] fancy: there have been many an offhand complaint when we do 2v2s and ratz
[4:22 PM] A Random Badger: idk then i cant speak for them
[4:22 PM] fancy: and lots of giving up because "oh I'm just bad"
[4:22 PM] fancy: yeah you all have different problems
[4:22 PM] fancy: like I said
[4:22 PM] fancy: you intentionally do shit that makes me more uptight
[4:22 PM] fancy: in your goal to get me to loosen up
[4:23 PM] A Random Badger: but i know for me, i play for fun in pubs, because i dont find joy in playing comeptitive against people who arent
4:23 PM] fancy: so you should rethink that strategy lol
[4:23 PM] fancy: I don't see the point in queueing for a dota game if you're not trying to win
[4:23 PM] fancy: that's the goal of the game
[4:23 PM] A Random Badger: theres a difference between trying to win
[4:24 PM] fancy: but you don't try to win badger
[4:24 PM] fancy: you try to fuck with me
[4:24 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Trying to categorize people in this discord are Adults or Children is not cool. You may not realize it Josh, but you do it so you can feel 'better' than the peoeple around you. If you put someone down, you feel up by comparison. The only thing you're accomplishing with that is creates distance between you and everyone else.  I think of everyone here as peers not adults vs. not adults. Even Badger. He's young but I really couldn't give a shit. He's a voice on a computer same as everyone.
[4:24 PM] A Random Badger: because most games i play with you you dont relax and it makes it just as annoying for me to play with you as it is you to play with us
[4:24 PM] fancy: then don't play with me lol
[4:24 PM] fancy: losing isn't fun for me
[4:25 PM] fancy: I don't enjoy losing just because I'm relaxed
[4:25 PM] fancy: lol
[4:25 PM] fancy: you know what I do to relax?
[4:25 PM] fancy: I play pad
[4:25 PM] fancy: I jerk off
[4:25 PM] fancy: I eat sandwiches
[4:25 PM] fancy: I drink juice
[4:25 PM] fancy: I nap
[4:25 PM] fancy: not play dota
[4:26 PM] fancy: I'm not that uptight in zombies
[4:26 PM] fancy: that's a more chill game
[4:26 PM] fancy: I'm not really uptight in ratz either
[4:26 PM] fancy: dota is my passion
[4:26 PM] fancy: I love that game
[4:26 PM] fancy: I want everyone to be good at it
[4:26 PM] fancy: I want to see good play
[4:27 PM] fancy: and yes Andrew, I do feel better than you because I can handle playing against people that are better than I am without yelling at them and telling them to fuck off(edited)
[4:27 PM] fancy: and I don't get mad when people laugh at stupid shit I do
[4:27 PM] fancy: so yeah
[4:27 PM] fancy: in that sense
[4:27 PM] fancy: which is the sense in which I refer to you guys as children
[4:27 PM] fancy: yes i feel superior
[4:28 PM] fancy: @Suck it, Moto!
[4:29 PM] fancy: and you can keep putting the blame on me, but the reality is that you guys have behaved in ways that push me to where I am
[4:29 PM] fancy: and you can either accept that or not
[4:29 PM] fancy: you're free to flame me for the ways in which I'm a child
[4:30 PM] fancy: I never claimed to be perfect
[4:30 PM] fancy: and I never will
[4:30 PM] fancy: I will always think I'm a piece of shit
[4:31 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Well you made your thoughts clear
[4:32 PM] fancy: So that's why I don't really enjoy playing games with you guys any more, I'd play cards or something, but it's clear you guys cant dissociate yourselves in other games for some reason, and I'd rather not engage in that
[4:33 PM] fancy: I have valued the talks we've had and ive enjoyed those
[4:33 PM] fancy: and the advice we've exchanged
[4:33 PM] fancy: and I think you're all pretty adult in those regards
[4:33 PM] fancy: but not when it comes to games
[4:33 PM] fancy: that's always been my whole point
[4:34 PM] A Random Badger: then go play more with those other people and not with us but ill tell you what, you're gonna be pretty sad if you find out all they cared about is youre fucking skill, and are only nice to you because you win games for them, because what are you going to do when they get comfortable and start acting like us because they know they can goof off but you'll still win them the game? you have such a unhealthy mentality for a passion and im trying to explain that to you but you obviously dont seem to care about yourself as much as we do, or at least i do. I want to play with the relaxed fancy who can joke around and have fun and play games where I can try hard with someone who will equally try as hard as I do in ranked. But your problem is, you try so hard at everything even when there's no logical point to it. And when I say, don't play with us anymore, I don't mean ever, play bo3 with us, play ratz with us, but not Dota 2 if you're just gonna try hard all the time and the fact that you only seen the downside of the issue for you and not us is also pathetic. Instead of trying to compromise with people who are your friends so you can both enjoy the game you simply put them off in your head as "children and idiots who dont care about you or the game" when both are false. Get that throw you're thick skull. You don''t need to be perfect, but that doesn't mean you should always work on yourself to make you a better you. I know more about this shit than most people for my age because I went through a lot of shit in life in my childhood.
[4:34 PM] fancy: oh god dude why you do me like this
[4:34 PM] fancy: mercy
[4:34 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Thinking that you're superior to the people around is a really arrogant thing. Telling me/us that you think you're supeior, and that you dont want to hang out with me/us bc you're better is a really douchey thing
[4:34 PM] A Random Badger: I put effort in to punctuating it this time just read it
[4:34 PM] fancy: yeah I'm trying dude
[4:35 PM] fancy: u fine lol
[4:35 PM] fancy: just stop messages for a sec so it doesn't move
[4:35 PM] fancy: okay so
[4:36 PM] fancy: I don't see anything unhealthy with wanting to win a competitively designed game
[4:36 PM] A Random Badger: thats not the unhealthy part but continue
[4:36 PM] fancy: then explain
[4:36 PM] fancy: more
[4:37 PM] A Random Badger: the unhealthy part is the expectation that everyone around you is also going to play as competitively as you are and you get frustrated about it, especially in pubs. I can fully go with you in ranked when our teeam and our opponents will be tryharding too, but in pubs when the enemy doesnt want to and I don't want to but you still want to, and then you get frustrated by us not trying AND the enemy not trying, that's unhealthy
[4:38 PM] A Random Badger: the big thing for me personally
[4:38 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Badger is right: it may seem like these other dota players appreciate you more but you havent known them for too long and they may not care about you like we do. From what you're saying Josh it seems like you'd rather do stuff with them instead of us and to me that's saddening
[4:38 PM] A Random Badger: is i dont want to try hard in pubs
[4:38 PM] A Random Badger: when the enemy isnt going to
[4:38 PM] A Random Badger: because then if i win
[4:38 PM] A Random Badger: i will feel bad because it wasnt a fair fight
[4:38 PM] A Random Badger: and if i lose
[4:38 PM] A Random Badger: ill feel worse because the enemy wasnt even trying
[4:38 PM] fancy: yeah I'd rather play games with them Andrew because they don't ruin my nights if shit goes bad
[4:39 PM] fancy: @A Random Badger I don't see how it's unhealthy to want everyone to try
[4:39 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Well what happens when they realize you can win games for them and they stop trying to improve? They'll just want you for all the wrong reasons.
[4:39 PM] fancy: and I think you extrapolate too much from that to the rest of my life
[4:40 PM] fancy: that's pretty rude Andrew
[4:40 PM] fancy: to assume their reasons
[4:40 PM] fancy: for being friends with me
[4:40 PM] fancy: I think you're also wrong
[4:40 PM] A Random Badger: its an unhealthy expectation tho because you get frustrated and that takes a toll on your mental health, as someone who knows a thing or two about it considerng I and my whole family suffer from mental health issues
[4:40 PM] A Random Badger: thats why it's unhealthy
[4:40 PM] fancy: I disagree
[4:41 PM] fancy: I don't think playing dota the way I do affects me negatively
[4:41 PM] fancy: outside of dota
[4:41 PM] fancy: I appreciate the concern
[4:42 PM] fancy: but I think you misjudge the extent of it
[4:42 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Im just trying to make you realize  that the people here care about you not just you playing videogames
[4:42 PM] A Random Badger: ... that's not necessarily something you can disagree with, its a fact, its like saying "the doctor told me apples are healthy for me so ill only eat apples" and then you wonder why you get sick down the line
[4:42 PM] A Random Badger: its the same way
[4:43 PM] fancy: it does work that way if I didn't tell the doctor I'm deathly allergic to apples
[4:43 PM] fancy: I know you guys care about me
[4:43 PM] Suck it, Moto!: and that with these new people you're talking about it's not a certaintiy like it is with us
[4:43 PM] fancy: but that was never the point
[4:43 PM] fancy: they can care about me too dude
[4:43 PM] fancy: lol
[4:43 PM] fancy: like yeah it's new
[4:43 PM] A Random Badger: if you constantly get frustrated over something that is supposed to be your passion, not only can it potentially damage you're passion for that game, but it can in the long term damage your mental health, you basically have 2 options, calm down or play with people that dont make you frustrated
[4:43 PM] fancy: and not as developed yet
[4:43 PM] fancy: but that doesn't make it worth less
[4:44 PM] fancy: and so: playing with other people badger
[4:44 PM] fancy: what's your point
[4:44 PM] Suck it, Moto!: What Im saying is you shouldnt friend-dump anybody in your haste(edited)
[4:44 PM] fancy: I didn't
[4:44 PM] fancy: I just don't play games here as much
[4:44 PM] A Random Badger: so do it, is it something i personally will be happy with? probably not because i think its a bad choice compared to compromising with your current friends that want to play with you, thats my point
[4:45 PM] fancy: why do you think I should stop playing the way I want
[4:45 PM] fancy: just because my friends don't want to
[4:45 PM] fancy: that seems dumb
[4:45 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Well the things you've said are pretty rude and depressing on my end.
[4:45 PM] fancy: same to you my dude
[4:45 PM] A Random Badger: you obviously havent seen the hints ive been throwing at you, especially regarding me personally
[4:45 PM] A Random Badger: if you want me to try hard
[4:45 PM] A Random Badger: QUEUE FOR RANED
[4:45 PM] fancy: I don't
[4:45 PM] fancy: play
[4:45 PM] fancy: ranked
[4:45 PM] A Random Badger: THEN I AND YOU CAN BE HAPPY
[4:46 PM] fancy: it's the same game
[4:46 PM] fancy: just less toxic
[4:46 PM] fancy: plus
[4:46 PM] fancy: I don't want to grind
[4:46 PM] fancy: 2000 mmr
[4:46 PM] fancy: like I don't get the mentality that unranked is for goofing off
[4:46 PM] fancy: it's literally the same mode now
[4:46 PM] fancy: you just can't see your mmr
[4:47 PM] fancy: because that matters
[4:47 PM] fancy: right
[4:47 PM] fancy: lol
[4:47 PM] fancy: if I were just starting sure I'd play ranked maybe
[4:47 PM] fancy: except you can't coach
[4:47 PM] A Random Badger: i disagree, pub people definitely dont take the game quite as seriously as evident by teh way our teammates, me, us, and our enemies play, plus who cares about mmr, you dont have to play raked just to get mmr, ranked and unranked use 2 seperate mmrs if i remember correctly
[4:47 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Well what the hell do we do now then
[4:48 PM] fancy: they do badger
[4:48 PM] fancy: hats why I don't want to play ranked now
[4:48 PM] fancy: I queue into VHS on unranked
[4:48 PM] fancy: and normal in ranked
[4:48 PM] fancy: fuck that lol
[4:48 PM] A Random Badger: okay i think i understand now
[4:48 PM] fancy: yeah
[4:48 PM] fancy: I don't wanna equalize them
[4:48 PM] A Random Badger: cause your pub mmr is higher than your ranked
[4:48 PM] fancy: yes
[4:48 PM] A Random Badger: and you dont want to grind up to it
[4:48 PM] A Random Badger: gotcha
[4:48 PM] fancy: yes
[4:48 PM] A Random Badger: thats fair
[4:49 PM] fancy: also no parties of 4
[4:49 PM] fancy: and no coaching
[4:49 PM] A Random Badger: yea
[4:49 PM] fancy: even tho coaching is broken af
[4:49 PM] A Random Badger: idk
[4:49 PM] fancy: rip coaching
[4:49 PM] A Random Badger: i suppose i can start try harding but i wont feel good about it if it appaers like our enemies aren't try harding
[4:49 PM] fancy: that happens on ranked too
[4:49 PM] fancy: people throw
[4:49 PM] fancy: and are toxic
[4:50 PM] fancy: I haven't seen any difference honestly
[4:50 PM] fancy: at least in my experience
[4:50 PM] fancy: I don't feel bad if I beat someone who chose not to try
[4:50 PM] fancy: I feel like they're kinda pathetic
[4:50 PM] fancy: but like
[4:50 PM] Subhanshu: k im' back
[4:50 PM] fancy: not my problem
[4:50 PM] Subhanshu: gonna read all the things
[4:50 PM] fancy: welcome
[4:50 PM] Subhanshu: brb in a year
[4:50 PM] fancy: enjoy book sir
[4:50 PM] fancy: I made u popcorn
[4:50 PM] fancy: :popcorn:
[4:51 PM] A Random Badger: okay im gonna brb and show kid game more
[4:51 PM] fancy: but yeah
[4:51 PM] A Random Badger: cause i kicked him off so i could do this lol
[4:51 PM] fancy: badger
[4:51 PM] fancy: tldr
[4:51 PM] fancy: is that
[4:51 PM] fancy: if you want me to loosen up
[4:51 PM] fancy: don't antagonize me aggressively lol
[4:51 PM] fancy: and mix in some good play
[4:51 PM] fancy: lol
[4:52 PM] A Random Badger: fine lol
[4:53 PM] fancy: @Suck it, Moto! I also don't think it's arrogant if I can back it up
[4:54 PM] fancy: I think I've earned the right to feel how I do
[4:58 PM] fancy: @Subhanshu make sure to @ me when you reply so I remember to check
[4:58 PM] fancy: I have to actually work now lul
[5:05 PM] Subhanshu: just got back and just read all of it
[5:12 PM] Suck it, Moto!: you're so wrong lol. being better at videogames and not tilting as much is no reason to think you are a superior human being than them and that they as a person aren't worth your time. Of course you can do whatever you want, no one is making you like me or play games with me. It wouldnt be friendship if I made you. But to write me off on the grounds that "you feel superior" and I'm not worth your time anymore is so hurtful because it makes me question whether you ever really gave a shit about me or not. You know better than a lot how really shitty people can be. I remember the stories about your friends in school and how you introduced them but they ended up shutting you out because they found something better in each other than in you. You know how it feels to be rejected and replaced for reasons you dont think are right. The way you've been treating everyone lately and what you said in this conversation shows that, if you think you have the right reasons, you'll justify being the same way to me and they did to you? Yes I was actually listening when you told me that stuff, I actually gave a shit. You couldn't believe how anyone could do that or stuff like it.  This whole arugement has been a big disullusion. You wouldnt be saying any of this shit if you didnt think you had a way out with this other group of friends. Friends are about accepting other peoples flaws and not tossing them aside just because you can.
[5:13 PM] Suck it, Moto!: @fancy
[5:14 PM] fancy: you blew what I said way out of proportion
[5:14 PM] fancy: again
[5:14 PM] fancy: you read what you want instead of what I wrote
[5:15 PM] fancy: insofar as
[5:17 PM] fancy: I am able to handle being beat
[5:17 PM] fancy: and not having a breakdown over it
[5:17 PM] fancy: and handling being poked fun at for doing dumb shit
[5:17 PM] fancy: in that arena
[5:17 PM] fancy: i am better
[5:17 PM] fancy: that's not the same as being better in every way
[5:17 PM] fancy: I think there are tons of things you guys are better than I am at
[5:18 PM] fancy: handling social situations
[5:18 PM] fancy: getting through uni
[5:18 PM] fancy: etc
[5:18 PM] A Random Badger: im still #1 Go player in this chat #rekt(edited)
[5:18 PM] fancy: you are sir
[5:18 PM] Subhanshu: I am #1 most likely to be brown in a year
[5:18 PM] Subhanshu: #rekt
[5:18 PM] fancy: also true
[5:18 PM] fancy: feelsbaniman
[5:18 PM] Subhanshu: okay so
[5:18 PM] Subhanshu: i read a lot of this
[5:18 PM] Subhanshu: i mean
[5:18 PM] Subhanshu: all of this
[5:18 PM] Subhanshu: and it was a lot
[5:19 PM] A Random Badger: I am #1 offlane main in TAW #rekt
[5:19 PM] Subhanshu: first off to answer the question of fancy's first question in csgo
[5:19 PM] Subhanshu: he is right
[5:19 PM] Subhanshu: like, you did complain about how the game worked and mechanics and movement control, but in a very different way
[5:19 PM] Subhanshu: that was preference, and you got used to it anyways
[5:20 PM] Subhanshu: but yes for the most part, when josh sucked ass at csgo, he kept going at it and focused on what he was doing wrong
[5:21 PM] fancy: and though I've been guilty of playing victim card heavily
[5:21 PM] fancy: in the past
[5:21 PM] fancy: ahem
[5:21 PM] Subhanshu: instead of blaming other factors (smurfs, dumb game mechanics, etc)
[5:21 PM] fancy: I dont think I did that
[5:21 PM] fancy: in that scenario
[5:21 PM] Subhanshu: like sure those things are obstacles, but he truly wanted to get better, and worked towards it
[5:22 PM] fancy: yeah I put a lot of time into it
[5:22 PM] Subhanshu: I don't truly believe you care to get better at csgo andrew
[5:22 PM] fancy: whereas with you guys
[5:22 PM] Subhanshu: If you wanted it enough, we'd see the actions
[5:22 PM] fancy: maybe you don't have as much time
[5:22 PM] fancy: but yeah, what shoe says
[5:22 PM] Subhanshu: I'm of the opinion that actions speak more than words
[5:22 PM] fancy: I said for long time I become soloq player
[5:22 PM] fancy: but not once have I soloqd
[5:22 PM] Subhanshu: I wanted to be fit and lose weight, but i clearlyd idn't want it over eating cheetos and playing videogames before
[5:22 PM] fancy: but I became arc player ez
[5:23 PM] Subhanshu: but i reached a point where I want it enough that i'm willing to cut out on all that and make sacrifices to get what I actually want
[5:23 PM] fancy: I just had to sacrifice my tendons in my fingers
[5:23 PM] fancy: gg rekt
[5:23 PM] fancy: and dum dum had to sacrifice pushups
[5:23 PM] fancy: on bad wrists
[5:23 PM] fancy: rofl
[5:23 PM] A Random Badger: i had to sacrifice a leg in a car accident once so i could live does that count?
[5:24 PM] fancy: ni
[5:24 PM] Suck it, Moto!: please just let him finish Josh half my screen is fluff
[5:24 PM] fancy: u still clown sir
[5:24 PM] A Random Badger: sadness
[5:24 PM] fancy: once clown always clown
[5:24 PM] A Random Badger: 18 and bum leg
[5:24 PM] A Random Badger: feelsoldman
[5:24 PM] Subhanshu: Yeah I'll try and organise my thoughts into one message with actual punctuation
[5:24 PM] fancy: uh every I said has correlated with what shoe says
[5:24 PM] Subhanshu: instead of spamming messages
[5:24 PM] Subhanshu: so gimme a bit
[5:24 PM] fancy: and paragraphs !!!!
[5:24 PM] fancy: no dude
[5:24 PM] fancy: that's spoon feeding
[5:24 PM] A Random Badger: fuck paragraphs
[5:24 PM] fancy: don't you know
[5:24 PM] fancy: rofl
[5:24 PM] Suck it, Moto!: wait Badger is that true?
[5:24 PM] A Random Badger: about my leg?
[5:24 PM] A Random Badger: yes
[5:24 PM] fancy: yeah he's a small son
[5:24 PM] A Random Badger: my leg is bad

[5:26 PM] fancy: something like that
[5:26 PM] A Random Badger: m wow dreams were ripped away
[5:26 PM] A Random Badger: by being ganked by life
[5:26 PM] fancy: I never had dreams

[5:27 PM] fancy: gg rekt
[5:27 PM] fancy: played myself
[5:27 PM] A Random Badger: i sold part of my leg to the devil does that count
[5:27 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Can you walk?
[5:27 PM] fancy: uhhh
[5:27 PM] fancy: sure
[5:27 PM] fancy: did you get a cookie ?

[5:28 PM] A Random Badger: but not in a straight line
[5:28 PM] A Random Badger: and its ahrd to run
[5:28 PM] A Random Badger: and painful
[5:29 PM] A Random Badger: i also dont drive
[5:30 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Man that must have been a huge change to go through
[5:30 PM] A Random Badger: because of anxiety
[5:30 PM] A Random Badger: well
[5:30 PM] A Random Badger: the i wasnt driving yet if thats what you mean by change
[5:30 PM] A Random Badger: tbh
[5:30 PM] A Random Badger: that day
[5:30 PM] A Random Badger: i went for my permit
[5:30 PM] Suck it, Moto!: No I just meant in general not the driving part
[5:30 PM] A Random Badger: and on the way back from the police barrack
[5:31 PM] A Random Badger: we got in the crash
[5:31 PM] A Random Badger: like
[5:31 PM] A Random Badger: 1/3 a mile away
[5:31 PM] A Random Badger: was like
[5:31 PM] A Random Badger: yep
[5:31 PM] A Random Badger: i dont want to drive anymore
[5:31 PM] A Random Badger: bye
[5:31 PM] Suck it, Moto!: totally understandable(edited)
[5:31 PM] A Random Badger: ah not really
[5:31 PM] A Random Badger: im a gamer lol
[5:31 PM] A Random Badger: i dont get around much
[5:31 PM] A Random Badger: i was never like a excersize kinda person
[5:31 PM] A Random Badger: walk and run everywhere lol
[5:31 PM] A Random Badger: i lifted a lot tho
[5:31 PM] A Random Badger: but the leg didnt stop that
[5:31 PM] A Random Badger: well
[5:32 PM] A Random Badger: it ended leg day lol
[5:32 PM] A Random Badger: feelsgoodman
[5:32 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I mean who does that anyway
[5:32 PM] A Random Badger: my legs actually used to be super strong from karate, but now its all just fatty where the muscle used to be lol
[5:33 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I never would have guessed that you had to deal with something like that. Your disposition is so lighthearted from what I've experienced
[5:33 PM] Suck it, Moto!: that probably sounds ridiculous to you lol
[5:35 PM] A Random Badger: lol idk i never had that mentality, i was always a pessimist
[5:36 PM] Suck it, Moto!: either way glad you're here. thanks for sharing
[5:39 PM] A Random Badger: i think life just revolves around luck, the unlucky will find a lot of bad things happen to them while the lucky will find a lot of good things to them. life is a game of draw straws in my opinion. thats my philosophy anyways, but i also dont look down on people who've had good things happen to them and i dont see other people who have bad things to them any worse than my own share of problems
[5:39 PM] Suck it, Moto!: That's fair
[5:41 PM] fancy: you get dealt cards
[5:41 PM] fancy: some good, some bad and no one deserves them any more than anyone else
[5:41 PM] fancy: such is life
[5:42 PM] A Random Badger: yea basically what i believe
[5:43 PM] Suck it, Moto!: In a lot of ways I feel lucky with the life I have, and pretty unlucky in other ways. I have what I do and don't what I dont. Sometimes I feel like all I really want is the things I dont and couldnt care less about some of the things I do. idk if that's really true tho
[5:43 PM] fancy: it is I think
[5:43 PM] fancy: no one asks you what cards you want
[5:44 PM] Suck it, Moto!: But I dont if the reason I want what I dont is because i dont have it or if I really do want it
[5:44 PM] A Random Badger: to clarify tho i dont beleive that like you're just dealt a straw or a hand of cards when youre born and that determines your life, i see every day, maybe even every minute as drawing a new straw, or a new hand of cards and that just determines what happens to you in that moment
[5:44 PM] fancy: well yeah
[5:44 PM] fancy: you keep getting cards
[5:44 PM] Suck it, Moto!: yeah
[5:44 PM] fancy: and reading them
[5:44 PM] fancy: trading
[5:44 PM] fancy: and losing them
[5:44 PM] fancy: and finding them
[5:44 PM] fancy: shit happens
[5:45 PM] Suck it, Moto!: and sometimes you get a card and it just is C4 and you have to just say "alright"
[5:45 PM] fancy: yup
[5:45 PM] fancy: sometimes you are ganked by China girl from Quebec
[5:45 PM] fancy: and you're like welp
[5:45 PM] fancy: such is life
[5:46 PM] Suck it, Moto!: is that a metaphor
[5:46 PM] fancy: no that's what happened to me
[5:46 PM] fancy: lol
[5:46 PM] fancy: ash is Chinese and from quebec
[5:47 PM] A Random Badger: but yea life is just a game of luck where no one really wins
[5:47 PM] A Random Badger: some people have fun and some people dont lol
[5:47 PM] Subhanshu: I think Josh said a lot of valid things. I've communicated this to him before, but it is sometimes difficult to sift through the things he says to find the things he means because of all the hyperbole he uses. But here's what he means and what he actually thinks (there are lots of things josh will say he feels or thinks that I don't think he really feels or thinks, but I'm listing what I know he knows or feels). I think that he is okay playing with bad players to an extent. I agree with him when he says that you guys behave like children all the time. For example, Julian does this thing frequently where he does something wrong, we give him advice after hearing his complaint about doing something wrong, and he throws a tantrum (i.e. "Oh, I guess i'll just not look at my screen and only stare at minimap." or "Oh, I guess I'll just sit in fountain to not get ganked.") That kind of shit gets super frustrating to have to deal with because, instead of Josh and I having to focus on the game and our own play and having a good time and winning, we also have to micromanage people's emotions and make sure that they don't cross the tilt line and throw a tantrum. In a similar fashion, he and I both feel like we have to moderate our play in 2v2's in csgo because otherwise you both will tilt. Now, where he and I differ is that I don't think it's necessarily wrong to get mad at that. I understand getting mad and frustrated and emotional when you're just the worst at something or not good enough to do what you visualize yourself being capable of doing. Like, I am the worst at disc golf out of you all (all who play in Tulsa in our group). But I don't tilt even when I'm by far the worst because it's not something I invest much time into. I play that game to play with friends, and I don't take it too seriously, evidenced by the fact that I never play on my own time nor do I spend any time researching or taking an honest effort to try and get better. But in the situation of
[5:47 PM] Subhanshu: you playing CSGO, when you play with us and you do the worst or you just have a bad game, you do get mad. You do tilt as if it's a game you take seriously. In my mind, that's not something I really think is mature or okay because it's not a game you actually invest time in, or do research to get better in. You only really play to spend time with friends. I understand it's not a good time to just not kill things and watch your friends kill things, in a similar manner that it's not a great feeling to have to throw a disc at a hole 7 times when all your friends did it in 3.  When Josh says that you guys perhaps haven't earned the right to complain and stuff, I think that's what he means. You guys don't put in a genuine effort to get better, and you still complain about being bad, or how the game isn't functional, etc. It just feels immature to complain about something that you can control and choose not to. You don't have as much time as Josh, sure. But if you really wanted to get better, you'd make the time. and cut out of other things, whether that's runescape or frolf or those things. And if you're not willing to do those things, that's still fine. But then don't complain as if you're as invested into the game as we are, because we want to get better more than you want to.
[5:47 PM] Suck it, Moto!: aight boiz here we go
[6:04 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I understand the point, but I dont think the analogy with you playing disc golf does not translates that well. You've played disc golf like once or twice since you moved to Indiana which is like 3 years ago. Whereas I've played 161 hours of CSGO since November 8th, Which is 8 months ago. I understand the point is we both have spent relatively little time devoted to it compared to our main hobbies/games. But to put that in porportion you playing disc golf twice (~3hrs) in 3 years would be like me playing CSGO for 35.7 minutes in the 8 months I had it installed. If I actaully only had 35.7 minutes logged in CSGO I wouldnt take it seriously and get mad.(edited)
[6:04 PM] Subhanshu: I'd play more frolf if it was more accessible, but there's no good course on campus and none of my friends play it
[6:04 PM] Suck it, Moto!: You are right that I get too mad and It makes it less fun for the people around me
[6:04 PM] Subhanshu: I don't care enough to get better at it to play alone
[6:05 PM] fancy: also
[6:05 PM] fancy: it deserves to be mentioned
[6:05 PM] fancy: lots of that csgo time isn't actively improving
[6:05 PM] Subhanshu: or actively trying to improve, rather
[6:05 PM] fancy: and csgo I think has a higher skill floor than frolf
[6:05 PM] fancy: yes
[6:05 PM] fancy: that
[6:05 PM] fancy: listen to him he has better English
[6:05 PM] fancy: rofl
[6:05 PM] fancy: I'm just an apple
[6:06 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I disagree with the skill floor thing but Its not worth arguing here
[6:06 PM] fancy: perhaps
[6:06 PM] Subhanshu: skill floor is pretty accurate
[6:06 PM] Subhanshu: in frolf to be basically competent
[6:06 PM] Subhanshu: takes less
[6:06 PM] fancy: yeah
[6:06 PM] Subhanshu: he's not saying the skill cap is higher
[6:06 PM] fancy: that's what I think
[6:06 PM] Subhanshu: he's saying that in order to be competent at frolt
[6:06 PM] Subhanshu: *frolf
[6:06 PM] Subhanshu: that takes less practice
[6:06 PM] Subhanshu: than being basically competent at csgo
[6:06 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I disgree
[6:07 PM] Subhanshu: it's far more layered obvously at face value
[6:07 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I dont want to get into this
[6:07 PM] fancy: weaaaak
[6:07 PM] Subhanshu: Do you consider yourself basically competent
[6:07 PM] fancy: :/
[6:07 PM] Subhanshu: or better than that
[6:08 PM] Subhanshu: at frolf
[6:08 PM] fancy: for reference
[6:08 PM] fancy: I think I'm barely basically competent at csgo
[6:08 PM] Subhanshu: yeah you're like 120% basically competent
[6:08 PM] Subhanshu: after 500 hours of pretty serious dedication
[6:09 PM] fancy: yeah gn2/3 is super aggressively average
[6:10 PM] fancy: vs I could learn to throw a disc in an afternoon I think
[6:10 PM] fancy: probs
[6:10 PM] Subhanshu: i don't think that' strue
[6:10 PM] Subhanshu: i think to be basically competent at frolf
[6:10 PM] fancy: I mean in a straight line
[6:10 PM] fancy: o
[6:10 PM] fancy: perhaps
[6:10 PM] fancy: if you think it's more than that
[6:10 PM] Subhanshu: i'm talking about frisbee golf
[6:10 PM] fancy: yeah
[6:10 PM] Subhanshu: it definitely si more than throwing in a straight line
[6:10 PM] fancy: i
[6:10 PM] fancy: o
[6:10 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I will say though that like how a lot of CSGO time is idle and not spent getting better, same is true with disc golf. In 18 holes of play in 1.5 hrs a noobie will probably throw 70-75 shots. The act of setting up a throw and exectuting it and watching to see what happens take a noobie player at most 10 secondsm or 12.5 min of the 1.5 hrs actually "playing"
[6:10 PM] Subhanshu: it would take a few dozen hours to be competent at it
[6:11 PM] fancy: idk what basically competent looks like
[6:11 PM] fancy: lol
[6:11 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Josh you could not learn how to throw a disc competently ina day
[6:11 PM] Suck it, Moto!: like im sorry
[6:11 PM] Subhanshu: and there are lots of different discs
[6:11 PM] fancy: you're not sorry
[6:11 PM] Subhanshu: and lots of techniques
[6:11 PM] fancy: don't lie lol
[6:11 PM] fancy: ah
[6:11 PM] fancy: I see
[6:11 PM] Subhanshu: and types of obstacles
[6:11 PM] Subhanshu: there is also slight strategy, but it's barely a factor honestly
[6:11 PM] fancy: tru
[6:11 PM] Subhanshu: the strategy is basically just be competent and not dumb
[6:12 PM] fancy: rofl
[6:12 PM] Subhanshu: as in like "use the right disc and throw this way, not on this other side"
[6:12 PM] Subhanshu: like you can approach a hole differently
[6:12 PM] fancy: ye
[6:12 PM] fancy: I got u
[6:12 PM] Suck it, Moto!: My brain is exploding
[6:12 PM] Subhanshu: correct me if i'm wrong andrew, that's just what i'm assuming
[6:13 PM] Subhanshu: i have never seen a pro frolf game so i'm probably speaking out of my league here
[6:13 PM] fancy: I imagined that being basically competent meant you could eventually throw the disc into the thing
[6:13 PM] fancy: in like
[6:13 PM] fancy: a reasonable amount of time
[6:13 PM] fancy: lol
[6:13 PM] Suck it, Moto!: it's not about time its about number of throws
[6:13 PM] Subhanshu: well i asked andrew he didn't answer
[6:13 PM] Subhanshu: do you consider yourself basically competent
[6:13 PM] Subhanshu: or more than that
[6:13 PM] Subhanshu: or less
[6:13 PM] fancy: if you're solo it's basically time lol
[6:13 PM] fancy: which is how I would practice
[6:13 PM] fancy: is solo
6:13 PM] Subhanshu: whoever's the best in our friend group, are they basically competent or better
[6:14 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Throwing a disc golf driver straight takes way more skill and strength that y'all think
[6:14 PM] fancy: yeah answer the brown man
[6:14 PM] Suck it, Moto!: and even then throwing it straight is not even an indicator of competency
[6:14 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Good players seldom through dead straight shots off the tee
[6:15 PM] Suck it, Moto!: and they better they are the easier they make it look lol
[6:15 PM] fancy: yeah but
[6:15 PM] fancy: answer
[6:15 PM] fancy: the brown man
[6:15 PM] fancy: lol
[6:15 PM] fancy: we're not talking good we're talking basically competent
[6:15 PM] Suck it, Moto!: whats the question? sorry
[6:15 PM] fancy: "just read it man"
[6:16 PM] Subhanshu: basically
[6:16 PM] Subhanshu: can you get par on a good course on some of the holes
[6:16 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Can I?
[6:16 PM] Subhanshu: not even talking about average, talking about competent
[6:16 PM] Subhanshu: i'm asking you
[6:16 PM] Subhanshu: you have a better understanding of what is the competency level
[6:16 PM] Subhanshu: than josh or me
[6:16 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I am competent yes
[6:17 PM] Subhanshu: are you basically competent
[6:17 PM] Subhanshu: or more than basically competent
[6:17 PM] Suck it, Moto!: more than
[6:17 PM] Suck it, Moto!: but yes
[6:17 PM] Subhanshu: okay
[6:17 PM] Suck it, Moto!: was the the question?
[6:18 PM] Suck it, Moto!: that
[6:18 PM] Suck it, Moto!: would vc help
[6:18 PM] Subhanshu: sore throat i'd rather not talk rn
[6:18 PM] Suck it, Moto!: ok
[6:19 PM] Suck it, Moto!: There's a mini tournament at 6 I might go play
[6:22 PM] A Random Badger: im back
[6:22 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I still dont understand why you asked if I am competent at disc golf
[6:22 PM] Suck it, Moto!: where was that going?
[6:22 PM] A Random Badger: and you guys are talking about some dumb shit
[6:24 PM] fancy: I report u badger
[6:24 PM] fancy: dw
[6:24 PM] fancy: I can VC while I work maybe
[6:24 PM] Subhanshu: because we were talking about basic competence
[6:24 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I think we essentially resolved the arugment that I get too mad at games and it makes it less fun for Josh and subhanshu when I rage.
[6:24 PM] fancy: if someone reads me what dumdum says
[6:24 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Now we are on a discgolf vs csgo tangent
[6:24 PM] Subhanshu: and how the basic competence level at csgo is harder to acquire
[6:25 PM] fancy: how much actual training did you do for disc golf
[6:25 PM] fancy: Andrew
[6:25 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I've been playing avidly for close to 4 years
[6:25 PM] fancy: right
[6:25 PM] fancy: not playing though
[6:25 PM] fancy: actual training
[6:25 PM] fancy: playing isn't the same as training
[6:25 PM] fancy: I didn't get good at csgo just by playing games
[6:26 PM] fancy: and by good I mean not garbo
[6:26 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I think playing casual rounds counts as practice, but yes, I've done countless hours of field work
[6:26 PM] Subhanshu: to b e fair
[6:26 PM] Subhanshu: if you assume that every time you go out and play frolf you play for two hours
[6:26 PM] Suck it, Moto!: like just going out into an open field and throwing drives for accuracy and distance
[6:26 PM] fancy: it's not that playing isn't practice it's that it's not training
[6:26 PM] Subhanshu: you've probably played less than 500 hours
[6:26 PM] Suck it, Moto!: over an over again
[6:26 PM] fancy: it's experience
[6:26 PM] fancy: but yeah thats training
[6:27 PM] fancy: like my csgo routine
[6:27 PM] fancy: was pretty
[6:27 PM] fancy: set
[6:27 PM] fancy: and it was tedious af
[6:27 PM] fancy: that sort of thing
[6:27 PM] fancy: vs I don't think you've done much more than play and maybe DM a bit
6:27 PM] Suck it, Moto!: If you count all my tournamnet play, casual rounds, field work, and putting practice, I probably have close to 1000 hours
[6:27 PM] Suck it, Moto!: maybe a little less
[6:28 PM] Suck it, Moto!: 950
[6:28 PM] Suck it, Moto!: However that doesnt even include athletic trainging that contributes to it
[6:28 PM] Suck it, Moto!: like running
[6:28 PM] Suck it, Moto!: lifting
[6:28 PM] fancy: and you're above average competence right
[6:28 PM] fancy: like what percentile
[6:28 PM] fancy: would you say you are(edited)
[6:29 PM] fancy: and what percentile is competent
[6:30 PM] Subhanshu: if you can compete in local tournaments and do [pretty well
[6:30 PM] Subhanshu: you're very above "basically competent"
[6:30 PM] fancy: yes
[6:30 PM] fancy: basically competent is the point where
[6:30 PM] fancy: you can start just saying that the person is playing the game
[6:30 PM] fancy: and not just completely lost
[6:30 PM] fancy: like in dota
[6:31 PM] fancy: avg MMR is like 2.5ishk
[6:31 PM] Suck it, Moto!: Many standard disc golf coursesare par 54 or par 3 on each of the 18 holes. If you can consistently get a score of 65, that means you know what you're doing
[6:31 PM] fancy: but competency doesn't start imo until 3.5
[6:31 PM] fancy: which is like 80th percentile
[6:31 PM] Suck it, Moto!: GOOD players can birdie holes, 2 strokes for par 3, and consistently get 3s
[6:31 PM] Suck it, Moto!: that's me
[6:31 PM] fancy: yeah
[6:31 PM] fancy: percentiles tho
[6:31 PM] Subhanshu: ^
[6:31 PM] fancy: like relative to people who play
[6:32 PM] fancy: disc golf
[6:32 PM] fancy: where are you
[6:32 PM] fancy: are you 55
[6:32 PM] fancy: 70
[6:32 PM] fancy: 60
[6:32 PM] fancy: 86
[6:32 PM] fancy: etc
[6:33 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I have no idea. There are PGDA ratings and like 850 is a a decent player rating to have. 1050 is like the best player in the world right
[6:33 PM] Suck it, Moto!: now
[6:33 PM] Suck it, Moto!: would have to look those numbers up
[6:34 PM] Suck it, Moto!: I dont have an PDGA account so I dont have a rating, it's like 100$ fee.
[6:34 PM] Suck it, Moto!: and the thing is, Virtually everyone with an account and rating are really good players
[6:35 PM] Suck it, Moto!: noobs wont pay for a membership
[6:35 PM] A Random Badger: The only game I truly study and train at is Go
[6:35 PM] A Random Badger: I study a shit ton of that shit
[6:35 PM] fancy: and you're still super avg aren't yoh
[6:35 PM] Suck it, Moto!: it would be like if you had to pay $100 to have your mmr tracked in dota
[6:35 PM] fancy: or are you good yet
[6:35 PM] fancy: idr
[6:35 PM] fancy: badher
[6:35 PM] fancy: badger
[6:35 PM] Suck it, Moto!: only like 5ks and above would have mmrs
[6:35 PM] A Random Badger: im almost at competency level
[6:35 PM] fancy: nice
[6:35 PM] A Random Badger: sdk level
[6:36 PM] A Random Badger: im high ddk level
[6:36 PM] fancy: but yeah we'd need percentiles to solve csgo debate
[6:36 PM] Suck it, Moto!: If I gave you a percentile I'd be pulling it out of my ass is what I'm saying
[6:36 PM] fancy: yeah
[6:36 PM] fancy: so we can't know
