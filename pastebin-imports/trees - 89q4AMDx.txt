[21:42 PM] fancy: okay so
[21:42 PM] fancy: can we have a real talk
[21:43 PM] Bani: maybe tomorrow
[21:43 PM] Bani: i'm pissed off
[21:43 PM] fancy: hmm
[21:43 PM] fancy: idk it's both related and not related to this
[21:44 PM] Bani: will it piss me off even more
[21:44 PM] fancy: depends
[21:44 PM] Bani: well then it can wait until tomorrow
[21:44 PM] fancy: do you get pissed off when people share opinions?
[21:44 PM] fancy: or concerns
[21:44 PM] fancy: well
[21:44 PM] fancy: idk concerns is maybe not the right word
[21:44 PM] fancy: complaints is too harsh
[21:45 PM] fancy: I guess like the root problem is that
[21:45 PM] fancy: at least for me I guess
[21:45 PM] fancy: is that I don't actually ever know what you're thinking
[21:45 PM] fancy: if that makes sense
[21:46 PM] fancy: so it makes it really hard to interact with you in a meaningful way
[21:46 PM] fancy: I'm sorry about the trees
[21:47 PM] fancy: and all the times you felt I was ever being actually mean to you
[21:47 PM] fancy: I don't mean to be cruel to you
[21:47 PM] fancy: it's hard for me to tell though, and this is maybe partially my fault for starting this meme? I don't really remember how it started
[21:47 PM] fancy: but the "you're mean" meme is thrown around a lot and it's kinda lost meaning
[21:48 PM] fancy: so I don't know if you ever actually mean it
[21:48 PM] fancy: but then like my other issue that's sorta like
[21:48 PM] fancy: unrelated a bit I guess?
[21:48 PM] fancy: is that like
[21:48 PM] fancy: you do this thing a lot where you say you want to do something, but then you don't actually agree to do things, or where you start something and then give up immediately
[21:49 PM] fancy: and do the whole helpless thing
[21:49 PM] fancy: and idk it's a little frustrating, at least for me, because I know you're not retarded
[21:49 PM] fancy: and you're pretty competent
[21:49 PM] fancy: and like, I unironically like what you were doing with your house(edited)
[21:50 PM] fancy: but you always brush all of this off and just do the "I can't do anything I'm bad and retarded :frowning: "
[21:50 PM] fancy: thing
[21:50 PM] fancy: and that kinda gets on my nerves a lot
[21:50 PM] fancy: because it isn't really true
[21:50 PM] fancy: and i don't know why you do it
[21:50 PM] fancy: this kinda goes back to the tf2 thing
[21:50 PM] fancy: where you didn't want to play with us
[21:50 PM] fancy: even when we asked
[21:50 PM] fancy: and your excuse was "i'm bad"
[21:51 PM] fancy: like, if you genuinely weren't interested, that's a perfectly valid excuse
[21:51 PM] fancy: but when you just use the "i'm bad" thing
[21:51 PM] fancy: idk it feels like you're pretending our entire friendship doesn't really exist I guess?
[21:51 PM] fancy: or that it's some merit based thing?
[21:51 PM] fancy: which is just a general feeling I guess that I have
[21:51 PM] fancy: because you're like
[21:51 PM] fancy: you'll listen to me talk about myself and stuff
[21:52 PM] fancy: or about things I like or what I think about things
[9:52 PM] fancy: but you don't really do that much
[9:52 PM] fancy: and it feels really weird
[9:52 PM] fancy: but like, the entire minecraft thing was kinda started because you said you wanted to play
[9:53 PM] fancy: and then you kinda just spend the entire time saying you can't do anything
[9:53 PM] fancy: and yeah there's been the recent issue where you can't be connected for very long
[9:53 PM] fancy: and I sympathize with that
[9:53 PM] fancy: but idk, can you at least understand what my perspective might be?
[9:53 PM] fancy: I don't know how good a job I'm doing explaining it
March 31, 2018
[01:01 AM] Bani: i don't think not knowing what i'm thinking is an excuse for the trees, i think it's pretty obvious it would piss anyone off
[01:02 AM] fancy: that may be true
[01:02 AM] fancy: however I can counter with
[01:02 AM] fancy: I think it's pretty obvious that intentionally trying to poke at someone
[01:02 AM] fancy: constantly
[01:02 AM] fancy: would piss them off
[01:03 AM] fancy: so I guess that's my real issue, that you get mad at the tree thing, but you're also perfectly okay with constantly teasing me
[01:03 AM] fancy: when it's pretty obvious, at least to me, that I don't like it(edited)
[01:04 AM] fancy: and further than that, I really hate it
[01:04 AM] fancy: I don't think it's funny to intentionally say things to make people mad
[01:04 AM] fancy: but so many people do it to me
[01:04 AM] fancy: "haha it's fun to tease fancy he gets so mad haha"
[01:07 AM] fancy: I say this not as a justification for why the trees shouldn't have upset you, but so you can have perspective on how I feel about being targeted constantly
[01:08 AM] fancy: because to me it's probably similar to how upset you were by the trees
[01:12 AM] fancy: but yeah idk that's kinda all I have to say I guess. I'm not really sure how much I can care about the resolution to any of these memes any more
[01:18 AM] Bani: the teasing is a totally separate issue, i think if i messed up your buildings that would be more similar to how i felt
[01:18 AM] fancy: no bani
[01:18 AM] fancy: I really really hate being teased
[01:18 AM] fancy: I hate when people intentionally say dumb things to upset me
[01:18 AM] Bani: you tease me all the time, there is a whole channel dedicated to teasing me
[01:18 AM] Bani: you and pizza both make fun of things i say
[01:19 AM] fancy: you say funny things
[01:19 AM] fancy: but you try to say things to upset me
[01:19 AM] fancy: if you don't like it then say it I guess
[01:20 AM] fancy: Yoshi does it too
[01:20 AM] fancy: pizza does it too
[01:20 AM] fancy: space did it
[01:20 AM] fancy: Brian did it
[01:20 AM] fancy: half the people in taw did it
[01:20 AM] fancy: roszara has done it
[01:20 AM] fancy: this is a pretty constant problem
[01:20 AM] fancy: and it's not like I just laugh it off
[01:21 AM] fancy: and go with it
[01:21 AM] fancy: you do
[01:21 AM] fancy: if you actually don't like it
[01:21 AM] fancy: then probably that's not the right response
[01:21 AM] fancy: but the semi-serious "leave me alone I'm tired :(" can't really be taken seriously
[01:22 AM] fancy: like I'm not trying to offend you but you kinda act like a caricature of yourself a lot of the time
[01:22 AM] fancy: which goes back to me not really knowing anything about what you're thinking
[01:23 AM] fancy: but I've explicitly said I don't like being teased
[01:25 AM] Bani: if it really pisses you off that much i feel like you have to say "i will not be your friend unless you respect me" or something
[01:26 AM] fancy: 

[1:26 AM] fancy: 

[01:26 AM] Bani: btw none of this is even relevant
[01:26 AM] Bani: to the orignal issue
[01:27 AM] Bani: you are just bringing this up now because it's like "you're mad at me? oh yeah well im mad at you too now you do stuff that annoys me as well"
[01:27 AM] fancy: this is very relevant
[01:27 AM] fancy: because the entire premise was that I don't think you're justified in getting mad at this when you are perfectly okay pissing me off
[01:27 AM] fancy: you can't have your cake and eat it too
[01:28 AM] fancy: for me, personally, if someone planted trees everywhere that took 15 minutes to clean up, I wouldn't give that much of a fuck
[01:28 AM] fancy: it's not like I just started being mad for being poked at
[01:28 AM] fancy: I've never liked being poked
[01:28 AM] fancy: I've always said it was a bad meme
[01:28 AM] fancy: remember the whole school thing
[01:30 AM] fancy: pizza puts blocks on my shit all the time
[01:30 AM] fancy: or intentionally doesn't sort things properly
[01:30 AM] fancy: or etc etc
[01:30 AM] fancy: and I just have to sigh and move on
[01:30 AM] fancy: so no, I don't think you can say I'd get just as mad about trees
[01:34 AM] fancy: but yeah idk if you don't actually care about how you treat me then that's fine and whatever I guess
[01:34 AM] fancy: badger doesn't either
[01:34 AM] fancy: so iduno
[01:34 AM] fancy: have fun with that I guess
[01:48 AM] Bani: so what i'm getting is
[01:48 AM] Bani: you make other people angry then say they shouldn't be angry and then expect an apology?
[01:48 AM] fancy: no
[01:48 AM] fancy: you missed the point
[01:49 AM] fancy: the second thing I did was apologize
[01:49 AM] fancy: and then I explained how you're being inconsistent
[01:49 AM] fancy: I never said you can't be angry
[01:49 AM] fancy: I said you can't justify being angry and also being okay with making me angry
[01:50 AM] fancy: which is what I mean by asking if you can see my perspective
[01:51 AM] fancy: because to me, it's incredibly hypocritical to constantly poke at me and then get angry at stuff like this
[01:52 AM] Bani: you guys constantly poke at me, i think it's fair
[01:52 AM] Bani: i never messed with your stuff
[01:52 AM] fancy: to me it's the same
[01:52 AM] Bani: plus you wanted to play games with me
[01:52 AM] Bani: and then you mess with my stuff
[01:52 AM] fancy: yeah and you spend the entire time saying how you can't do anything and you suck(edited)
[01:52 AM] Bani: and i tried for like two days to get my game working
[01:52 AM] fancy: it's really frustrating
[01:52 AM] fancy: even before it stopped working
[01:54 AM] fancy: you don't think I should care about you basically telling me to kill myself and go back to being depressed, or trying to poke me until I react
[01:54 AM] fancy: and I don't think you should care about trees
[01:54 AM] fancy: you do mess with my stuff
[01:54 AM] fancy: it's just in a different way
[01:54 AM] fancy: there's a reason I posted the video I did before
[01:54 AM] fancy: and why I say I feel bullied
[01:55 AM] fancy: but everyone conveniently ignores that
[01:55 AM] fancy: because they don't think it's an issue
[01:55 AM] fancy: but this is the same thing as the trees
[01:56 AM] fancy: so we can either all take the punches if we're gonna throw them
[1:56 AM] fancy: or we can stop punching each other
[1:57 AM] fancy: either way I really find it hard to care any more
[02:00 AM] Bani: what is that supposed to mean lol
[02:01 AM] fancy: about the punches?
[02:01 AM] Bani: that you find it hard to care anymore
[02:01 AM] fancy: because I'm really tired of people refusing to understand the words I'm writing
[02:01 AM] fancy: because i don't think it's very hard
[02:01 AM] fancy: and I'm tired of double standards
[02:01 AM] fancy: and people being assholes
[02:02 AM] fancy: like there's a difference between
[02:02 AM] fancy: relevant one-off comments
[02:02 AM] fancy: that are funny
[02:02 AM] fancy: and constant targetting
[02:02 AM] fancy: who else do you poke at like you poke at me
[02:02 AM] fancy: who else does yoshi poke at like he pokes at me
[02:03 AM] fancy: who else does badger poke at like he pokes at me
[02:03 AM] fancy: that gets really old really fast
[02:03 AM] fancy: but then if I turn it around
[02:03 AM] fancy: everyone gets upset
[02:04 AM] fancy: you all can't have your cake and eat it too
[02:04 AM] fancy: so either take the punches or stop throwing them
[02:07 AM] fancy: I'm pretty much never going to talk to badger again(edited)
[02:07 AM] fancy: because of things like this
[02:17 AM] Bani: i mean, yeah i suppose that's your choice
