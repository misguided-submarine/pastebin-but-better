[6:41 PM] A Random Badger: Lost my 2 baby pheasants to the fucking pit bull and nearly killed another chicken
[6:41 PM] fancy: don't tell me more people died
[6:41 PM] A Random Badger: Really wanted to kill it
[6:41 PM] fancy: oh
[6:41 PM] A Random Badger: I killed the fence instead
[6:41 PM] fancy: that's not a healthy response
[6:41 PM] A Random Badger: Then I fixed it
[6:41 PM] A Random Badger: I fixed it tho
[6:42 PM] fancy: getting irrationally angry is the unhealthy part
[6:42 PM] fancy: not the broken fence
[6:43 PM] A Random Badger: I'd say it was pretty rational. You take care of something and raise it for so long just so someone's neglegence ruins it all
[6:43 PM] A Random Badger: I'd react the same way if I found out a drunk driver killed a family member of mine
[6:43 PM] A Random Badger: And I think most sane people would
[6:45 PM] fancy: I don't think that's the definition of healthy
[6:46 PM] fancy: Like sure be upset
[6:46 PM] fancy: but I don't think not being able to control your physical response is healthy
[6:46 PM] fancy: it may be natural
[6:46 PM] fancy: but naturally I want to eat nothing but sugar
[6:46 PM] fancy: also unhealthy
[6:53 PM] A Random Badger: letting your anger and stress build up is also very unhealthy, in fact i'd say its even more unhealthy from experience considering that can kill you very quickly. everyone needs an outlet in some shape or form for their anger. i dont have a punching bag, ad punching a pillow sure aint gonna outlet a whole lot, video games dont help with the anger either, so i punch the fence, i break a few boards, i fix it back up.  ill take the risk of a broken hand over the risk of my anger building up so much i end up hurting someone or something else
[6:55 PM] fancy: There's a difference between holding it in and controlling it
[6:56 PM] fancy: Just because you don't react emotionally immediately doesn't mean you don't have outlets
[6:56 PM] fancy: you're creating a false dichotomy here
[6:56 PM] fancy: the two options aren't punch the fence or never let your anger out
[6:56 PM] fancy: that wasn't even the issue
[6:57 PM] fancy: you can break fences and rebuild them all day, it's not important
[6:57 PM] fancy: the point was that immediately resorting to something destructive shows a lack of control over your emotional reactions, which is the unhealthy part
[6:58 PM] A Random Badger: i mean it was immediate it was later after the fact
[6:58 PM] A Random Badger: the problem was i had no other way to outlet that anger
[6:58 PM] fancy: Perhaps
[6:58 PM] A Random Badger: i mean ive tried other available outlets
[6:58 PM] A Random Badger: but it doesnt properly outlet any of the anger
[6:59 PM] A Random Badger: as far as anger is concerned that is
[6:59 PM] fancy: Also perhaps
[7:01 PM] A Random Badger: i mean thats not a perhaps thats just it, i cant afford to go to the nearest gym and pay the fee, running around the block doesnt work, i cant afford martial arts any more, lifting random heavy objects like im at the gym doesnt help, playing various other video games might distract me but it doesnt outlet the anger like it does stress, working the next day doesnt outlet any of it, jjust serves another distraction. so it just builds up.
[7:04 PM] fancy: Once again, my only response is: perhaps
[7:04 PM] A Random Badger: but y 'perhaps'
[7:04 PM] fancy: Because that's what I can say about it
[7:04 PM] fancy: perhaps what you say is true
[7:04 PM] fancy: I can neither confirm nor deny
[7:05 PM] fancy: I can agree or disagree
[7:05 PM] fancy: but that's effectively the same as saying perhaps
[7:05 PM] fancy: I can only make my perspective available
[7:05 PM] fancy: I can neither convince you to consider it nor implement it
[7:07 PM] fancy: All I know is, I've also said "x just is how it is" or "x just doesn't work" a lot in my life(edited)
[7:07 PM] fancy: and my track record of correctness is not too impressive
[7:07 PM] A Random Badger: uh but you havent really offered your perspective on an alternative, you said that it was wrong to lash out imediately in anger, thats its better to control it, which i can control it, i can hold it in all day and relax but that anger isnt really gonna go away,
[7:07 PM] A Random Badger: um
[7:07 PM] A Random Badger: im confused
[7:08 PM] fancy: you are often
[7:15 PM] fancy: I don't have a perspective on the alternative other than it exists
[7:15 PM] fancy: As in: there are more things in the world than what you listed
[7:15 PM] A Random Badger: oh sure but nothing that ive been able to find yet and idk if its worth bottling up until that alternative is found
[7:16 PM] fancy: Additionally: Just because you think it doesn't work doesn't make it so, which is why I said what I did about my track record
[7:16 PM] fancy: Because a lot of it is mental
[7:16 PM] fancy: And a lot of it is just learning that you can decide to not be angry
[7:16 PM] fancy: or sad
[7:16 PM] fancy: or etc
[7:17 PM] A Random Badger: uh i dont think its quite that simple as far as how you said it
[7:17 PM] fancy: I said the same thing
[7:17 PM] fancy: once
[7:17 PM] fancy: actually I said it many times
[7:17 PM] fancy: to be accurate
[7:17 PM] fancy: lol
[7:17 PM] A Random Badger: well let me get to what i mean
[7:21 PM] A Random Badger: cause all a emotion is, is a chemical reaction, different emotions are the result of different chemicals or w.e, due to the law of equivalent exchange, you can't just, remove that chemical reaction and pretend it didnt happen, you have to convert it in some other way so it doesnt have a negative effect on you. i think you can learn to be able to mentally trigger a chemical reaction through a lot of particular mental excersizes and practice but thats not necessarily as simple as just "dececing not to be (emotional)" so a lot of people need a particular physical or mental outlet in other forms in order to convert that energy (im not quite sure what to call it cause im not too educated on the subject obviously) to something more positive or neutral in the least
[7:22 PM] A Random Badger: i think i have that right anyways
[7:25 PM] fancy: That is all true
[7:25 PM] fancy: And what I said was
[7:26 PM] fancy: you can decide not to be angry
[7:26 PM] fancy: Which isn't the same as not feeling angry
[7:26 PM] fancy: You'll feel angry sure
[7:26 PM] fancy: But you don't have to hold on to that and bottle it up
[7:26 PM] fancy: you can decide to just let it go
[7:27 PM] fancy: and that is generally more healthy and more productive
[7:27 PM] fancy: than not
