[1:53 AM] fancy: do you ever wonder
[1:53 AM] fancy: what you're doing with your life
[1:55 AM] saucy: every day
[1:55 AM] saucy: is something wrong
[1:55 AM] fancy: idn
[1:55 AM] fancy: it's late and I'm still up
[1:55 AM] fancy: so I'm being existential probably
[1:55 AM] fancy: lol
[1:56 AM] fancy: I need to quit and go to school
[1:56 AM] fancy: but it's also like
[1:56 AM] fancy: idk
[1:56 AM] fancy: some other things too I guess are bothering me some
[1:57 AM] fancy: https://youtu.be/f0bbDFRYD_A
[1:57 AM] fancy: I like this
[1:57 AM] fancy: it's nice
[1:59 AM] saucy: do you want to talk about like what is bothering you
[1:59 AM] saucy: oh, this sounds sad
[1:59 AM] saucy: i like it too
[2:01 AM] fancy: I wish my phone had a headphone jack man
[2:01 AM] fancy: the future sucks
[2:01 AM] fancy: lol
[2:01 AM] fancy: but like
[2:01 AM] fancy: idk
[2:01 AM] fancy: it's kinda hard to say without sounding like a douche I guess
[2:02 AM] saucy: like an audio jack?
[2:02 AM] saucy: and it's fine
[2:03 AM] saucy: if it will make you feel better, go ahead
[2:04 AM] fancy: I have a lot of issues
[2:04 AM] fancy: I still don't think I'm a very good person
[2:05 AM] fancy: And I have this feeling almost all the time where I am super worried that I am... really deluded, I guess is a way to put it
[2:06 AM] fancy: like
[2:06 AM] fancy: everyone always thinks they're the good guy
[2:07 AM] fancy: and that they're right and they know what's going on
[2:07 AM] fancy: and a lot of the time, we make fun of those people for being so sure they're right, but being wrong about it
[2:07 AM] fancy: and I worry that maybe I'm on the wrong side of the coin a lot of the time
[2:07 AM] fancy: and what if it's not everyone else that's fucking dumb or stupid or insane or whatever
[2:08 AM] fancy: and it's actually just me
[2:08 AM] fancy: this happens a lot at work
[2:08 AM] fancy: because my friend and I complain to each other a lot(edited)
[2:08 AM] fancy: and we like validate each other's issues
[2:09 AM] fancy: and I guess I worry about one day ending up realizing that I've built myself an echo chamber out of the people that I associate myself with
[2:10 AM] fancy: I don't know if I'm doing a good job explaining this feeling
[2:12 AM] saucy: no, i actually get it
[2:12 AM] saucy: like you're not sure if you're actually as right as you think you are
[2:12 AM] saucy: i'm just not sure about the last part
[2:12 AM] saucy: with the echo chamber
[2:13 AM] saucy: how does this make you sound like a douche though
[2:13 AM] fancy: well there's more
[2:13 AM] fancy: idk why I started here it wasn't my original idea
[2:13 AM] fancy: lol
[2:13 AM] fancy: but the echo chamber is just like
[2:13 AM] fancy: waking up to realize that I've surrounded myself with people
[2:13 AM] fancy: who all agree with me
[2:13 AM] fancy: and so I never actually challenge anything I think
[2:14 AM] fancy: and so I just end up being wrong forever
[2:14 AM] fancy: because of the reassurance I get from thinking people agree with me
[2:14 AM] fancy: except we're all wrong
[2:14 AM] fancy: if that makes sense
[2:15 AM] fancy: I'm kinda obsessed with being right
[2:15 AM] fancy: and I try really hard to like
[2:16 AM] fancy: make sure that manifests as me trying to be right and not me insisting that whatever I think is right
[2:16 AM] fancy: but I just worry that I don't do a good job I guess
[2:16 AM] fancy: and I worry if like
[2:17 AM] fancy: that's actually a good goal to have
[2:18 AM] fancy: Pizza got a new computer recently
[2:18 AM] fancy: and a job
[2:18 AM] fancy: and he's been spending a lot more time like
[2:18 AM] fancy: going out with friends from work and shit(edited)
[2:18 AM] fancy: and obv being busy working
[2:19 AM] saucy: do you feel like jealous of him or something?
[2:19 AM] saucy: but okay yeah, i definitely understand what you mean now
[2:19 AM] fancy: he's spending more time than I thought playing like
[2:19 AM] fancy: other games
[2:19 AM] fancy: and like
[2:19 AM] fancy: iduno
[2:20 AM] fancy: I'm more bothered by it than I'd like to be
[2:20 AM] saucy: of him playing another games?
[2:20 AM] saucy: other*
[2:20 AM] fancy: yeah
[2:20 AM] fancy: and like
[2:20 AM] fancy: being more busy
[2:20 AM] fancy: he hasn't been to taw in a while
[2:20 AM] fancy: and he's like
[2:21 AM] fancy: it's not like Im choosing to not go, I'm just not home
[2:21 AM] fancy: like yesterday
[2:21 AM] fancy: cus after work he went out with friends
[2:21 AM] fancy: and I'm like well no
[2:21 AM] fancy: that is a choice
[2:21 AM] fancy: so even he's not even really being honest with himself about his motivations I suppose
[2:22 AM] fancy: but it's like
[2:22 AM] fancy: fine I guess
[2:22 AM] fancy: it just feels like
[2:22 AM] fancy: what I expected for a long time tbh
[2:22 AM] fancy: where it's like
[2:22 AM] fancy: eventually
[2:22 AM] fancy: he would move on too
[2:22 AM] fancy: get a job
[2:22 AM] fancy: and a life
[2:22 AM] fancy: and want to do other things
[2:23 AM] fancy: and replace the time spent with me with new people
[2:23 AM] fancy: makes me feel stagnant I guess
[2:23 AM] fancy: idn I have a really hard time getting along with people in general
[2:23 AM] fancy: I don't play nice with most people
[2:24 AM] fancy: so I never do anything with anyone like irl
[2:27 AM] saucy: so are you like afraid of losing pizza
[2:27 AM] saucy: or you just don't like it that people around you are doing other things
[2:27 AM] fancy: I'm... not sure
[2:27 AM] saucy: while you feel like you're still stuck with the same routine
[2:27 AM] fancy: I think
[2:27 AM] fancy: honestly before
[2:28 AM] fancy: I felt a lot like the center of attention
[2:28 AM] fancy: I think pizza was more dependent on me before actually
2:29 AM] fancy: whether it was true or not idk
[2:29 AM] fancy: but it feels different now
[2:29 AM] fancy: when it's like
[2:29 AM] fancy: oh
[2:30 AM] fancy: things happen outside me
[2:30 AM] fancy: and I guess it's
[2:30 AM] fancy: making me feel in ways I wouldn't have expected
[2:30 AM] fancy: cus I always thought I didn't like being the center of attention
[2:30 AM] fancy: maybe I do
[2:33 AM] fancy: https://youtu.be/8fEoWA9Vz3A
[2:33 AM] fancy: I like his voice
[2:37 AM] saucy: so you kind of feel like you've been replaced?
[2:37 AM] saucy: btw i hope you don't mind me asking questions
[2:38 AM] saucy: i'm just trying to understand how you feel
[2:38 AM] saucy: oh i like his voice too
[2:38 AM] saucy: honestly the mv reminded me of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzQ82Ny1ToI
[2:38 AM] saucy: i used to like this back in high school lol
[2:39 AM] fancy: wow not available
[2:39 AM] fancy: thanks obama
[2:39 AM] fancy: and yeah I guess a bit
[2:39 AM] saucy: what the fuck
[2:39 AM] saucy: seriously
[2:39 AM] saucy: one sec
[2:40 AM] saucy: i think what you're feeling is reasonable
[2:40 AM] saucy: nobody wants to be replaced
[2:40 AM] saucy: and i know pizza was like really there for you
[2:41 AM] saucy: but like, at the same time he does have his own life to live
[2:41 AM] saucy: and people do change overtime especially during adulthood
[2:42 AM] saucy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4opY4pgDoHA
2:42 AM] saucy: hmmmm
[2:43 AM] saucy: do you feel like any resentment towards him for like not spending as much time with you now?
[2:46 AM] fancy: a little bit
[2:47 AM] saucy: do you still play anything with him at all?
[2:47 AM] fancy: I played 1 csgo game today with them but iduno
[2:48 AM] fancy: they dont join discord and I mute in game chat
[2:48 AM] fancy: he was just talking with a friend from work in a different discord
[2:49 AM] fancy: I feel like I should be happy for him that he has a PC that isn't a toaster now
[2:50 AM] fancy: but I do not feel like that
[2:50 AM] fancy: I guess
[2:50 AM] saucy: if i had to guess, and i could be completely wrong, but you should be happy for him since a nice PC is always great
[2:50 AM] saucy: but you feel like every since he got the new PC, he hasn't been spending as much time with you as you'd like?
[2:50 AM] saucy: i think it is kind of rude to not talk to you while you're playing together though
[2:51 AM] saucy: have you asked him to discord with you if you guys play together?
[2:51 AM] fancy: I guess I had a different idea of what it would be like
[2:51 AM] fancy: and iduno it's weird cus like
[2:51 AM] fancy: honestly I find myself being in discord with people during games less and less pleasant
[2:52 AM] fancy: like
[2:52 AM] fancy: so
[2:52 AM] fancy: I've been playing with this other group of people in dota a couple times recently
[2:52 AM] fancy: they don't even have a discord
[2:52 AM] fancy: they just always use in game voice
2:52 AM] fancy: and honestly I find myself preferring that
[2:53 AM] fancy: I think because there isn't the extraneous noise
[2:53 AM] fancy: because of voice activation
[2:56 AM] saucy: ooooh
[2:56 AM] saucy: so they only say whats relevant
[2:56 AM] saucy: and thats what you prefer?
[2:56 AM] fancy: I think so
[2:56 AM] fancy: I play better that way at least
[2:57 AM] fancy: I get less frustrated
[2:57 AM] fancy: and tilt less
[2:59 AM] saucy: oh, makes sense
[2:59 AM] saucy: do you think you'd prefer that with pizza?
[3:00 AM] fancy: I'm not sure any more tbh
[3:00 AM] fancy: like
[3:00 AM] fancy: half of me doesn't enjoy playing with him sometimes
[3:00 AM] fancy: iduno
[3:00 AM] fancy: I'm conflicted
[3:01 AM] saucy: oooooh
[3:01 AM] fancy: he likes doing stupid shit I guess
[3:01 AM] saucy: hmmm originally i was going to suggest talking to him and ask if you guys can play like a few times together in a week
[3:01 AM] saucy: so you'd rather play seriously?
[3:01 AM] fancy: I always rather play seriously basically
[3:01 AM] fancy: I don't do the like

[3:20 AM] saucy: ooooh okay
[3:20 AM] saucy: i thought it was like bothering you for a while or something lol
