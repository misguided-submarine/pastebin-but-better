SARA: We can get your stuff in today or tomorrow Iâ€™m at work no...

[8:44 PM] A Random Badger: here you go
[8:44 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[8:44 PM] A Random Badger: idk
[8:44 PM] A Random Badger: but yea prior to this was literally me explaining the same thing to you but to her
[8:45 PM] A Random Badger: and she was like okay my dad is calling inspector today
[8:45 PM] A Random Badger: and then after this she was like okay monday we should be in
[8:46 PM] fancy: .........
[8:46 PM] A Random Badger: and like yea we are friends??? kinda
[8:46 PM] A Random Badger: we get along and what not really well in person
[8:46 PM] fancy: you are a strange man
[8:46 PM] A Random Badger: did a lot of work on the house together
[8:46 PM] A Random Badger: we knew each other prior to them dating
[8:47 PM] A Random Badger: but i imagine he either has some serious insecurity issues
[8:47 PM] A Random Badger: or just anger and control issues
[8:47 PM] fancy: I think ur both dum
[8:47 PM] fancy: that's my official analysis
[8:47 PM] A Random Badger: well what he did was certainly dum
[8:48 PM] A Random Badger: ig i should mention a week or 2 prior to this we had a conflict over the same thing
[8:48 PM] A Random Badger: where he was like
[8:49 PM] A Random Badger: you have feelings for sara and you need to eliminate them and be amture
[8:49 PM] A Random Badger: mature*
[8:49 PM] A Random Badger: and i was like uh ok
[8:49 PM] fancy: do you???
[8:49 PM] A Random Badger: and that was p much it
[8:49 PM] A Random Badger: at this point no
[8:49 PM] A Random Badger: years ago
[8:49 PM] A Random Badger: i did
[8:49 PM] fancy: you should tell him you're probably just a social retard
[8:49 PM] A Random Badger: in high school
[8:49 PM] fancy: lol
[8:49 PM] A Random Badger: uh idk he prob wouldn't accept that
[8:50 PM] A Random Badger: but anyways
[8:50 PM] A Random Badger: he was also like
[8:50 PM] fancy: he's dum
[8:50 PM] fancy: your response was weird tho
[8:50 PM] A Random Badger: cause if i told her dad you were in love with her he'd lose all respect for you
[8:50 PM] A Random Badger: and sara would never do anything with youu even if you were the last man on earth
[8:50 PM] A Random Badger: and i was like
[8:50 PM] A Random Badger: ok
[8:50 PM] A Random Badger: ??
[8:50 PM] A Random Badger: in the paste bin?
[8:50 PM] A Random Badger: yea
[8:50 PM] fancy: yes
[8:51 PM] A Random Badger: it was a bit later and i was stewing in my thoughts
[8:51 PM] fancy: you probably should
[8:51 PM] fancy: drop the
[8:51 PM] fancy: nobody understands me
[8:51 PM] fancy: edgy memes
[8:51 PM] fancy: just as a life pro tip
[8:51 PM] A Random Badger: well it wasnt even used for that
[8:51 PM] fancy: just in general tho
[8:51 PM] A Random Badger: it was used in coorelation to how he seems to act and think that he knows what i do and why im doing it and what intentions i have
[8:51 PM] A Random Badger: and im like okay enough
[8:51 PM] A Random Badger: what do you know about me
[8:52 PM] A Random Badger: cause literally speaking ive never opened up to him in any way
[8:52 PM] A Random Badger: we hardly know each other in a personal sense
[8:52 PM] A Random Badger: cause thats the type of person i am
[8:52 PM] A Random Badger: i just dont open up
[8:52 PM] A Random Badger: especially with people that are kinda friends but not people i socialize much with
[8:52 PM] A Random Badger: yanno
[8:53 PM] A Random Badger: but the whole pity part
[8:53 PM] A Random Badger: thats something ive felt between mine and sara's relationship for a long time
[8:53 PM] A Random Badger: she was the first person i did open up to
[8:53 PM] A Random Badger: and only a bit
[8:53 PM] A Random Badger: and ever since i felt like she didnt actually give a fuck about me
[8:53 PM] A Random Badger: she just pitied me
[8:54 PM] A Random Badger: ive felt like she just feels like she would never want to be in my position and thats why she pities me
[8:54 PM] A Random Badger: and just has a blind sympathy and feeling of obligation to help me
[8:54 PM] A Random Badger: like with inviting me to be her roommate
[8:54 PM] A Random Badger: and helping me through some things
[8:54 PM] A Random Badger: but we dont do
[8:54 PM] A Random Badger: friend things
[8:55 PM] A Random Badger: ive tried
[8:55 PM] A Random Badger: but like theres no interest to be had there
[8:55 PM] A Random Badger: in just friendly things
[8:55 PM] A Random Badger: and i feel the same way with him
[8:55 PM] A Random Badger: maybe pre-sara
[8:55 PM] A Random Badger: he liked me
[8:56 PM] A Random Badger: but now that they're dating
[8:56 PM] A Random Badger: im pretty sure sara has told him some things about me
[8:56 PM] A Random Badger: obviously she must've
[8:56 PM] A Random Badger: and he probably hates me
[8:56 PM] A Random Badger: either because of old feelings ive had
[8:56 PM] A Random Badger: or just because i talk and have talked to her for so long
[8:57 PM] A Random Badger: but he probably treats me decently
[8:57 PM] A Random Badger: becaus he pities me
[8:57 PM] A Random Badger: thats my opinion
[9:02 PM] fancy: when you say friendly things
[9:02 PM] fancy: what does that mean
[9:02 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[9:02 PM] fancy: I think you have a poor understanding of emotions tbh
[9:02 PM] fancy: and other people
[9:02 PM] A Random Badger: tru
[9:02 PM] fancy: that's just my opinion
[9:02 PM] A Random Badger: but at the time
[9:02 PM] A Random Badger: just like
[9:02 PM] A Random Badger: what other people did with friends
[9:02 PM] fancy: because you say things like "she only cares cus of her empathy"
[9:02 PM] fancy: which is super absurd lol
[9:03 PM] A Random Badger: like having conversations, hanging either together or with other friends
[9:03 PM] A Random Badger: p much it
[9:03 PM] A Random Badger: high school friendship stuff ig
[9:04 PM] A Random Badger: is it that absurd to think thats what it is tho
[9:04 PM] A Random Badger: because i honestly believe it
[9:04 PM] A Random Badger: i consider it very seriously
[9:05 PM] A Random Badger: idk
[9:05 PM] A Random Badger: we used to do friendly things
[9:06 PM] fancy: no that's an absurd statement to make
[9:06 PM] A Random Badger: hang out with friends, together, and have conversations
[9:06 PM] fancy: because it means nothing
[9:06 PM] A Random Badger: wym
[9:06 PM] A Random Badger: explain the error
[9:09 PM] fancy: that's like saying
[9:09 PM] fancy: oh you just like cake because it's tasty
[9:10 PM] fancy: or saying that "leaves are only green because they reflect that particular wavelength of light"
[9:14 PM] fancy: what do you think is the most frequent reason for any person to like any other person
[9:15 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[9:15 PM] A Random Badger: prob mutual interests
[9:15 PM] A Random Badger: or just like
[9:15 PM] A Random Badger: being funny
[9:15 PM] A Random Badger: or nice
[9:15 PM] A Random Badger: or smth
[9:16 PM] fancy: friends over mutual interests is usually the shallowest of friend types
[9:17 PM] fancy: any kinda of deeper meaningful relationship is more or less founded on empathy
[9:17 PM] A Random Badger: isnt there a bit of a different between some caring for you as a person and someone caring about you simply because they feel bad and think helping will just make them feel good
[9:18 PM] A Random Badger: i think i described that wrong
[9:18 PM] A Random Badger: uh
[9:18 PM] A Random Badger: like
[9:18 PM] fancy: that's literally the only reason anyone ever helps anyone else
[9:18 PM] fancy: people are 100% selfish
[9:19 PM] A Random Badger: sure but isnt that just as shallow if not more because you dont actually care for that person as a person
[9:19 PM] fancy: there's no such thing as "caring about someone as a person" beyond that
[9:19 PM] A Random Badger: i find this difficult to understand
[9:19 PM] fancy: how so
[9:20 PM] A Random Badger: it is just all very difficult to understand
[9:20 PM] fancy: this is pretty simple
[9:20 PM] fancy: imo
[9:20 PM] fancy: way more simple than how most people think it works
[9:20 PM] fancy: people like things because it makes them feel good
[9:20 PM] fancy: sometimes seeing other people happy makes you feel good
[9:20 PM] fancy: now this might seem strange
[9:20 PM] fancy: you may ask
[9:21 PM] fancy: "but fancy, how does good things happened to someone else make me feel good??"
[9:21 PM] fancy: that's what empathy is
[9:21 PM] fancy: being able to understand and partially partake in a feeling that someone else is experiencing or has experienced
[9:22 PM] A Random Badger: no i understand that
[9:22 PM] A Random Badger: my problem is like
[9:22 PM] A Random Badger: can you really consider someone a friend who doesnt want to really associate with you at all beyond when its necessary
[9:23 PM] A Random Badger: like
[9:23 PM] fancy: depends
[9:23 PM] A Random Badger: "oh i helped you and you feel good? great! bye now" dont hear for that person ever again until you need to go to them for more hlep
[9:23 PM] fancy: she didn't have to offer you a place to live
[9:24 PM] fancy: if she doesn't like to hang out with you
[9:24 PM] fancy: there could be like
[9:24 PM] fancy: 55 reasons for that
[9:24 PM] A Random Badger: but i feel like she only did because she knew at the time i was on the verge of going homeless or even commiting suicide due to issues where i was living
[9:24 PM] fancy: yeah that's a pretty nice gesture from her
[9:25 PM] fancy: it's very easy to be like
[9:25 PM] fancy: lol nope not my problem
[9:25 PM] fancy: "she only offered because she knew I needed help"
[9:25 PM] fancy: doesn't that sound absurd
[9:25 PM] A Random Badger: but this is my point yanno
[9:26 PM] A Random Badger: when i question our friendship like i do now
[9:26 PM] A Random Badger: she reassures me that we are friends
[9:26 PM] A Random Badger: but outside that theres nothing there
[9:26 PM] A Random Badger: other than she likes to help me through my problems
[9:26 PM] fancy: that seems like a pretty bang up friend to have
[9:27 PM] fancy: if you guys don't have mutual interests then yeah you won't hang out much
[9:27 PM] fancy: if her boyfriend hates you
[9:27 PM] fancy: which apparently
[9:27 PM] fancy: he seems to
[9:27 PM] fancy: then you probably won't be able to hang out that much
[9:27 PM] A Random Badger: but we dont even have casual conversation anymore
[9:27 PM] A Random Badger: like ever
[9:27 PM] fancy: there's like 50000 reasons that make more sense than "we aren't friends"
[9:28 PM] fancy: I mean
[9:28 PM] fancy: if today was any indication
[9:28 PM] fancy: her boyfriend has probably been complaining
[9:28 PM] fancy: for a while now
[9:28 PM] fancy: to her(edited)
[9:28 PM] A Random Badger: well im talking years
[9:28 PM] A Random Badger: way before this
[9:28 PM] A Random Badger: last time we had like
[9:28 PM] A Random Badger: way before this
[9:28 PM] A Random Badger: last time we had like
[9:28 PM] A Random Badger: casual conversations
[9:28 PM] A Random Badger: was when we first started talking
[9:28 PM] fancy: you should also consider that maybe you're not the most enjoyable casual conversationalist
[9:28 PM] A Random Badger: and we used to have like really long late night meaningful conversations
[9:29 PM] A Random Badger: at a point
[9:29 PM] A Random Badger: anything like that
[9:29 PM] A Random Badger: even brief conversations
[9:29 PM] A Random Badger: stoppped
[9:29 PM] A Random Badger: completely
[9:29 PM] fancy: happens
[9:29 PM] fancy: people get busy
[9:29 PM] fancy: my dad talks to his friends like twice a year maybe
[9:29 PM] fancy: she's got a boyfriend and a job
[9:29 PM] fancy: that's like
[9:30 PM] fancy: 80% of the week
[9:30 PM] fancy: at least
[9:30 PM] fancy: there's so many factors here
[9:30 PM] fancy: that I can't possibly know
[9:31 PM] fancy: and I don't think you have the self-awareness that you'd need to accurately assess it
[9:31 PM] A Random Badger: you're probably right
[9:31 PM] fancy: you could probably ask her
[9:31 PM] fancy: how come we never talk
[9:31 PM] fancy: and shell say
[9:31 PM] fancy: oh I'm just really busy
[9:31 PM] A Random Badger: wellllllll
[9:32 PM] A Random Badger: probably not the best idea for the near future
[9:32 PM] fancy: but hey, she offered you a place to live that's more than anyone in high school I knew would have done for me
[9:32 PM] A Random Badger: but yea it just sucks because it feels like theres not a single person that likes who i am
[9:32 PM] fancy: have you considered not being so down all the time
[9:32 PM] fancy: lol
[9:33 PM] A Random Badger: maybe when i was back in high school
[9:33 PM] A Random Badger: and had mor energy
[9:33 PM] fancy: people don't like downers
[9:33 PM] fancy: it makes them feel bad
[9:33 PM] A Random Badger: i was pretty comedic back in high school
[9:33 PM] A Random Badger: obviously that still shows a lot of the time in me
[9:34 PM] fancy: you come off as trying a bit too hard tho
[9:34 PM] fancy: tbh
[9:34 PM] fancy: when trying to be funny
[9:34 PM] fancy: idk if you pick up on that
[9:34 PM] A Random Badger: as a result of my martyrdom complex, maybe, i've always gone our of my way for others
[9:35 PM] fancy: I don't know if you have that
[9:35 PM] A Random Badger: well you said it once
[9:35 PM] A Random Badger: and i looked into it
[9:35 PM] A Random Badger: and it kinda seems like it
[9:35 PM] A Random Badger: maybe
[9:35 PM] fancy: cus u discriminate who you go out of the way for
[9:36 PM] fancy: but anyway
[9:37 PM] A Random Badger: not really, i've given up on roszara nearly but ive still gone out of my way to find anyway to help her with her shit that she's gone through, despite my attempts of pushing people away, i havent with you so much but thats because you always seem to cold and analytical, but most others, provided im aware they are going through something, i go out of my way to help
[9:37 PM] fancy: im not a doctor and I don't believe in self-diagnosing
[9:38 PM] fancy: yeah except every time I tell you that x bothers me you're like lol xd and continue doing it
[9:38 PM] fancy: soooo
[9:38 PM] fancy: xd
[9:38 PM] A Random Badger: its a specialty of mine
[9:39 PM] fancy: uh huh
[9:39 PM] fancy: but yeah
[9:39 PM] fancy: idk if you've ever considered any of these types of things
[9:39 PM] fancy: like
[9:39 PM] fancy: the casual conversation falling off
[9:39 PM] fancy: the people kinda getting sick of you(edited)
[9:39 PM] fancy: and leaving you behind
[9:39 PM] fancy: etc
[9:40 PM] fancy: considered that as feedback
[9:40 PM] fancy: granted, some of it is natural
[9:40 PM] fancy: high school friends are low quality cus everyone in high school is an idiot
[9:40 PM] fancy: so you grow out of those
[9:41 PM] fancy: but there's still feedback to be gained
[9:41 PM] fancy: and I don't think you really parse your interactions for it
[9:41 PM] fancy: you kinda just keep on doing your thing and go "yeah well sounds about right" when things go the same way they always do
[9:41 PM] fancy: imo
[9:44 PM] A Random Badger: perhaps, but my self esteem has p much been obliterated through high school and its nearly impossible for me to make any meaningful friendships with others
[9:44 PM] fancy: that's a thing you can work on
[9:45 PM] A Random Badger: sounds like make a fool of yourself enough times that eventually you'll be better with people however as a consequence everyone you interacted with prior will hate you because you made a fool of yourself
[9:45 PM] fancy: please
[9:45 PM] fancy: people don't remember that shit
[9:46 PM] fancy: plus like
[9:46 PM] fancy: who cares if someone you'll never meet again thinks you're a little weird or awkward
[9:46 PM] fancy: I already think you're a little weird and awkward
[9:46 PM] fancy: so I mean
[9:46 PM] fancy: is it really that bad lol
[9:47 PM] A Random Badger: except it feels like in my current situation im never really going to leave this area and encounter new people so the impressions i make on the people i know now feel important
[9:48 PM] fancy: aren't there like
[9:48 PM] fancy: 50000 billion people
[9:48 PM] fancy: wherever you live
[9:48 PM] A Random Badger: im p sure no locale has a populace that high
[9:48 PM] fancy: I rounded
[9:48 PM] fancy: plus like
[9:48 PM] fancy: people let stuff go all the time
[9:49 PM] fancy: you think I've never been awkward around my current friends???
[9:49 PM] fancy: or said something stupid and had to apologize?
[9:49 PM] fancy: or told a joke that fell flat
[9:49 PM] fancy: or etc etc
[9:50 PM] A Random Badger: thats fine and all but i still feel like i lack fundamentals to start even interacting with people other than online
[9:50 PM] A Random Badger: online is easy
[9:50 PM] A Random Badger: cause it starts based on mutual interest
[9:50 PM] fancy: I don't have any irl friends
[9:50 PM] fancy: well
[9:50 PM] fancy: that's not really true
[9:50 PM] fancy: I have work friends
[9:50 PM] fancy: idk just
[9:50 PM] fancy: shadow me for a day
[9:50 PM] fancy: cus fun fact
[9:51 PM] fancy: I've only ever been asked out
[9:51 PM] fancy: I've never asked anyone out
[9:51 PM] fancy: of the now three girls I've dated
[9:51 PM] fancy: so
[9:51 PM] fancy: clearly I'm doing something right I guess
[9:52 PM] A Random Badger: ive been asked out once, recently too, ive asked out plenty, gone on dates plenty, failed plenty, only dated 1 woman and neither of us initiated it by asking either of us out
[9:53 PM] fancy: I ruin all my relationships cus I'm an asshole who doesn't have standard views of love
[9:53 PM] fancy: so
[9:53 PM] fancy: if all your dates go poorly
[9:53 PM] fancy: you're probably doing something wrong
[9:53 PM] fancy: or
[9:53 PM] fancy: they aren't going that poorly and you're just not very perceptive
[9:54 PM] A Random Badger: well my last date was okay, awkward but okay, but she didnt like me
[9:54 PM] A Random Badger: that was all
[9:54 PM] fancy: happens
[9:54 PM] A Random Badger: i dont even remember how i asked her out
[9:55 PM] A Random Badger: i remember the whole lead up being very awkward tho
[9:55 PM] A Random Badger: especially awkward
[9:55 PM] A Random Badger: emphasis on the awkward
[9:55 PM] A Random Badger: we work together, we still kinda talk
[9:56 PM] A Random Badger: my work buddy jordan was like, you should date her when she asked me something about a product
[9:56 PM] A Random Badger: and i was like nah she prob has a boyfriend
[9:56 PM] A Random Badger: (classic typical excuse i make mind you)
[9:56 PM] A Random Badger: then jordan proceeded to go out of his way
[9:56 PM] A Random Badger: really awkward like
[9:56 PM] A Random Badger: and ask her
[9:57 PM] fancy: Lol
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: if she was dating anyone
[9:57 PM] fancy: high five him
[9:57 PM] fancy: what a bro
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: im p sure he expected to like own me severely
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: cause we bully each other
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: i think he was disappointed when he found out we actually went on a date
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: theres more to it
[9:57 PM] fancy: lmao
[9:57 PM] A Random Badger: this was quite a few months ago
[9:58 PM] A Random Badger: i dont remember it that well
[9:58 PM] A Random Badger: the one girl i knew from front end who was friends with her i talked to about her
[9:58 PM] A Random Badger: and i think she put in some words for me without my knowing
[9:58 PM] A Random Badger: cause then the girl was like
[9:58 PM] A Random Badger: really outward about me
[9:58 PM] A Random Badger: if that makes sense
[9:59 PM] A Random Badger: and i was
[9:59 PM] A Random Badger: very
[9:59 PM] A Random Badger: awkward
[9:59 PM] A Random Badger: i was prob a huge let down for her
[9:59 PM] fancy: as in
[9:59 PM] fancy: ?
[9:59 PM] A Random Badger: which
[9:59 PM] A Random Badger: the let down part?
[10:00 PM] fancy: yeah
[10:00 PM] A Random Badger: i mean that as in she probably either actually was attracted to me or just expected me to be a bit more confident
[10:00 PM] A Random Badger: but uh
[10:00 PM] A Random Badger: yea no way
[10:00 PM] fancy: what
[10:00 PM] fancy: how did you let her down
[10:00 PM] fancy: did you go on a date
[10:00 PM] A Random Badger: yes
[10:00 PM] fancy: and?
[10:00 PM] A Random Badger: she didnt like me
[10:01 PM] A Random Badger: prob cause i was not confident
[10:01 PM] A Random Badger: at all
[10:01 PM] fancy: like she said that explicitly
[10:01 PM] fancy: or
[10:01 PM] fancy: is that your impression
[10:01 PM] A Random Badger: the impression
[10:01 PM] A Random Badger: she didnt even tell me she didnt like me
[10:01 PM] fancy: high chance you're wrong tbh
[10:01 PM] A Random Badger: i had to find out from her friend
[10:01 PM] fancy: lol wtf
[10:01 PM] A Random Badger: our mutual friend
[10:01 PM] A Random Badger: yea
[10:01 PM] A Random Badger: thats actually
[10:01 PM] A Random Badger: a common trend
[10:01 PM] A Random Badger: for me
[10:01 PM] A Random Badger: i was not surprised
[10:02 PM] A Random Badger: no one wants to tell me directly
[10:02 PM] A Random Badger: that they dont like me
[10:02 PM] A Random Badger: or smth
[10:02 PM] fancy: no one wants to tell anyone they don't like them
[10:02 PM] fancy: that's a universal trend
[10:02 PM] fancy: you're not special lol
[10:02 PM] A Random Badger: true
[10:02 PM] A Random Badger: i wish i could ask what about me she didnt like
[10:03 PM] fancy: you probably could
[10:03 PM] A Random Badger: especially considering leading up like i said she was very "outward"
[10:03 PM] fancy: there's ways to do that
[10:03 PM] A Random Badger: wym
[10:05 PM] A Random Badger: i wouldnt want to put her on the spot yanno
[10:05 PM] fancy: I mean
[10:06 PM] fancy: don't ask her in public or some shit
[10:06 PM] fancy: but there's definitely ways to be like
[10:06 PM] A Random Badger: well no if anything i'd ask her over facebook or smth
[10:06 PM] fancy: hey I'm sorry you didn't have a good time was it anything in particular I did or was it just a bad match?
[10:07 PM] A Random Badger: well idk if she didnt have a good time
[10:07 PM] A Random Badger: also i feel like its odd to phrase it that way after so long
[10:07 PM] A Random Badger: but yea
[10:07 PM] fancy: how long
[10:08 PM] fancy: ?
[10:08 PM] A Random Badger: i almost feel like i'd be more direct and start a conversation about the date and then just pop the question quite literally why she didnt like me
[10:08 PM] A Random Badger: 3 months maybe 4
[10:08 PM] fancy: that's bad.
[10:08 PM] fancy: don't do that.
[10:08 PM] fancy: also even if it was a while ago
[10:08 PM] fancy: just say hey I was just thinking the other day and I never really said sorry for if you had a bad time etc etc etc
[10:09 PM] fancy: and if she says fuck off then oh well
[10:09 PM] fancy: move on with life
[10:09 PM] A Random Badger: maybe i will sometime
