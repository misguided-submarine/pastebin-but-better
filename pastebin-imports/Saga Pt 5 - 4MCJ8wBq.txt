[12:11 PM] fancy: and yields nothing useful practically speaking
[12:11 PM] fancy: other than byproducts developed as a part of the process of making things to survive going to space
[12:13 PM] fancy: but yeah most inventors weren't incentivized by being noble or something(edited)
[12:13 PM] fancy: they do it out of curiosity
[12:13 PM] fancy: or passion
[12:13 PM] fancy: or whatever
[12:14 PM] fancy: it's all self seeking
[12:16 PM] A Random Badger: yea youre right i just admire the ones that do things more for the benefit of society rather than just curiosity, but then again i dont hate people who are like that either, i dont hate musk either, i just have a distaste for the way he acted with openai
[12:17 PM] A Random Badger: i was having this same conversation with ros too seeing as how maybe it'd be something she'd be interesting in discussing
[12:17 PM] fancy: I don't think those people exist
[12:18 PM] A Random Badger: little to say that she holds a grudge over it now because she must have a huge hard on for musk and no appreciation for the conversation at all
[12:18 PM] A Random Badger: apparently
[12:19 PM] fancy: I don't think that's accurate
[12:19 PM] A Random Badger: whats not
[12:19 PM] fancy: she has less patience than I do usually
[12:19 PM] fancy: what you said about rosz(edited)
[12:19 PM] A Random Badger: ig
[12:19 PM] A Random Badger: but she seemed much nastier in response to the conversation
[12:19 PM] fancy: what did you say
[12:20 PM] A Random Badger: like almost literally the same things i told you
[12:20 PM] A Random Badger: how i didnt appreciate how it seems like hes more boastful and concerned more for the monetary value of the accomplishment rather than the technological value of it
[12:21 PM] A Random Badger: etc etc
[12:21 PM] A Random Badger: same conversation
[12:21 PM] A Random Badger: just
[12:21 PM] A Random Badger: different responses
[12:21 PM] A Random Badger: im kinda over her at this point tho
[12:21 PM] A Random Badger: like w.e
[12:21 PM] fancy: different patiences
[12:21 PM] A Random Badger: more like little to no respect
[12:21 PM] fancy: I mean
[12:21 PM] fancy: no(edited)

[12:22 PM] fancy: lol
[12:22 PM] A Random Badger: i feel like thats the way it was
[12:22 PM] A Random Badger: seemed very nasty about the whole thing
[12:22 PM] fancy: I don't respect your position either except insofar as I recognize it as a valid position to hold
[12:22 PM] fancy: but I am more patient
[12:23 PM] fancy: to explain why I think you're wrong
[12:23 PM] A Random Badger: refused to have a intellectual conversation about something unless its something that can be agreed upon
[12:23 PM] A Random Badger: and i think tis disrespectful
[12:23 PM] fancy: she doesn't have the energy
[12:23 PM] fancy: she's fucking dying man
