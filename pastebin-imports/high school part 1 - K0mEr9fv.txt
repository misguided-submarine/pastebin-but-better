[12:16 AM] Jiesus: could we please have some sort of event for people trying to clear savage content
[12:17 AM] Jiesus: or something? i know many of you have retired this tier 3 months ago or whatever but it's getting disheartening to see ppl not want to help people catch up
[12:17 AM] Jiesus: it's nobody's responsibility to help out of course, but it'd be wonderful if we could have some community in the FC for learning the current tier before 5.4
[12:21 AM] Byeong Ha: here comes swarles
[12:21 AM] Byeong Ha: watch out
[12:21 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I help out when I can but excluding Shin, most of use stop raiding once we've cleared it and gotten BiS on one or two classes
[12:22 AM] Jiesus: exactly
[12:22 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): We prog it when it's current, so it burns us out
[12:22 AM] Jiesus: this is understandable
[12:22 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): It's different progging now when the average player is 490 but we progged at 470 so we did A LOT more wipes xD
[12:22 AM] Jiesus: however not everybody has the luxury of doing so, and being ignored by FC members that have a lot of experience is kind of.. disheartening lol
[12:23 AM] Jiesus: so this should make it less of a hassle to help out then, correct?
[12:23 AM] Jiesus: this isn't @ you swarles btw
[12:23 AM] Jiesus: you helped me with my first e5s clear
[12:23 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I mean, event or not, people can just not show up xD
[12:23 AM] Jiesus: shin has helped me out
[12:23 AM] Jiesus: ....
[12:23 AM] Jiesus: okay
[12:23 AM] Jiesus: it'd be cool to have people in FC caught up
[12:23 AM] Jiesus: instead of struggling through horrid PF's
[12:23 AM] Jiesus: lol
[12:24 AM] Jiesus: and if we had an event for it maybe more ppl would get involved??
[12:24 AM] Jiesus: and if not, did we rly lose anything?
[12:24 AM] Byeong Ha: i dont mind setting an official time
[12:24 AM] Byeong Ha: like sunday from 1 - 3
[12:24 AM] Jiesus: i think that's a great idea
[12:24 AM] Byeong Ha: but ppl gotta actually show up
[12:24 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): We aren't losing anything but IMO I think we'd be scheduling an event for the same turn out xD
[12:25 AM] Jiesus: i feel as though you are thinking from your own perspective
[12:25 AM] Jiesus: because you're burnt out and have prog'd everything multiple times
[12:25 AM] Jiesus: gotten high parses, etc
[12:25 AM] Jiesus: but MANY fc mates want to do savage content but are too scared to
[12:25 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I'm willing to help, as seen by the many times I have, but you gotta realize that people like @shin (hi) are exceptionally rare cases of people that have beaten it and still enjoy doing it
[12:26 AM] shin (hi): I have been @
[12:26 AM] shin (hi): yeah I'm not normal
[12:26 AM] shin (hi): I'm insane
[12:26 AM] Jiesus: is there any enjoyment in helping others...?

[12:26 AM] Byeong Ha: mad
[12:26 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): No. Gotta make everyone mad on the internet. Didn't you know that? xD
[12:26 AM] shin (hi): most people didn't really enjoy this tier
[12:26 AM] Byeong Ha: theres a new cinematic
[12:26 AM] shin (hi): from what I remember
[12:26 AM] Byeong Ha: to firmament
[12:27 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I'm not opposed to you making an event, but I'm just trying to explain that scheduling an event isn't more of an incentive for those that have already cleared to help out
[12:28 AM] shin (hi): I don't know anyone else that raids as much as I do still tbh
[12:28 AM] shin (hi): like I have 2.5 groups plus when I help you guys plus then when I'm not doing that I'm in PF
[12:29 AM] Jiesus: incentive should be building an FC community that helps others out
[12:29 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): That's not helping others though. It's work teaching
[12:29 AM] Jiesus: because finding a static is impossible and everybody knows how fucking awful PF is yet that's most people's only option
[12:29 AM] shin (hi): but like you don't necessarily need vets to clear it
[12:29 AM] shin (hi): you just need 8 people
[12:29 AM] shin (hi): they can all be fresh
[12:30 AM] Jiesus: i'm getting a lot of pushback and nobody seems to be remotely interested in this
[12:30 AM] Jiesus: so i'm gonna can it
[12:30 AM] Jiesus: lol
[12:30 AM] shin (hi): I mean
[12:30 AM] shin (hi): up 2 u
[12:30 AM] Jiesus: i've gotten a lot of feedback from fc mates
[12:30 AM] Jiesus: about this kind of thing
[12:30 AM] shin (hi): people that are interested in savage?
[12:30 AM] Jiesus: yes
[12:31 AM] Jiesus: and um
[12:31 AM] shin (hi): then get them all together and do it
[12:31 AM] shin (hi): I can fill in when I don't have other things scheduled
[12:31 AM] shin (hi): and it makes it easier if I know ahead of time
[12:31 AM] shin (hi): or if you schedule the days I haven't already filled
[12:32 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Like I said, I'm willing to help. But you gotta realize that teaching and progging E6S isn't fun. It's a literal job :p
[12:32 AM] shin (hi): FUCK 6
[12:32 AM] shin (hi): that is all
[12:32 AM] Jiesus: idk i like teaching i have a different perspective i guess
[12:32 AM] shin (hi): I don't mind teaching but it is work
[12:32 AM] Jiesus: for sure
[12:32 AM] Jiesus: but watching somebody get a clear for the first time is fuckingawesome
[12:32 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): You ARE a teacher xD
[12:32 AM] shin (hi): if I didn't like teaching I wouldn't have adopted 2 fresh groups
[12:32 AM] shin (hi): but that being said
[12:33 AM] Jiesus: again this isn't @ either of you
[12:33 AM] Jiesus: because, you know, you 2 are the reason i've cleared e5s in the first place
[12:33 AM] Jiesus: lol
[12:33 AM] shin (hi): yeah but how many other people are there that have already cleared that also play consistently still
[12:33 AM] Jiesus: sadly, like, none
[12:33 AM] shin (hi): if there's interest from people who haven't done savage then all you need is to get 8 of them together and go for it
[12:33 AM] Jiesus: half our officers are on hiatus lol
[12:34 AM] Byeong Ha: von has cleared everything
[12:34 AM] Byeong Ha: he wont help us
[12:34 AM] Jiesus: von hasn't cleared anything rly?
[12:34 AM] shin (hi): there's tons of resources
[12:34 AM] shin (hi): u don't need us
[12:34 AM] Jiesus: i shall drop it
[12:34 AM] Byeong Ha: thing is i dont mind helping
[12:34 AM] Byeong Ha: but i have to heal
[12:34 AM] Byeong Ha: cuz otherwise i have to learn the runs myself
[12:34 AM] shin (hi): lmao
[12:34 AM] Byeong Ha: i cant focus on others
[12:35 AM] Byeong Ha: like idk how to dps
[12:35 AM] shin (hi): wym byeong you haven't progged every fight on every role yet?
[12:35 AM] shin (hi): XD
[12:35 AM] Byeong Ha: im not in 2.5 statics no XD
[12:35 AM] shin (hi): lmao
[12:35 AM] Byeong Ha: madness
[12:36 AM] Jiesus: judging by the responses i'm getting, it doesn't make me want to try lol
[12:36 AM] Jiesus: do y'all hate this tier that much? xD
[12:36 AM] shin (hi): I mean, if you're saying there's a lot of interest from people who've never done it before, that should be all the interest you need
[12:37 AM] shin (hi): no they've just done it a million times already
[12:37 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): It may seem like it's just my opinion, but like 95% of the entire FFXIV raid community that has cleared the tier is burnt out from it and will never go back in xD
[12:37 AM] shin (hi): basically the only people that still do it are streamers and the 1% that are like me
[12:38 AM] Byeong Ha: as of this time
[12:38 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): the way raiders look at it is the same way 99.99999% of people look at doing older content.. synced...
[12:38 AM] Byeong Ha: there are 25 pf
[12:38 AM] shin (hi): but yeah 100% if you have interest from a bunch of people in the FC just go for it, idk why you'd get discouraged by vets saying they can't guarantee they'll be around for it
[12:38 AM] Jiesus: byeong pf is fucking horrid
[12:38 AM] Byeong Ha: i know
[12:38 AM] Jiesus: i just wasted like an entire week on PF
[12:38 AM] Byeong Ha: but what im saying is
[12:38 AM] Byeong Ha: there are ppl willing to prog
[12:38 AM] Byeong Ha: im not saying to clear
[12:38 AM] Byeong Ha: hear me out
[12:38 AM] Byeong Ha: but to prog
[12:38 AM] Byeong Ha: so even if you still miss 1 or 2 players
[12:38 AM] Byeong Ha: u will be able to prog
[12:38 AM] Byeong Ha: u dont NEED vets as we mentionned earlier
[12:39 AM] Byeong Ha: it helps a lot sure
[12:39 AM] shin (hi): ur still lightyears ahead of me
[12:39 AM] shin (hi): it took me like
[12:39 AM] shin (hi): months + 300 pulls to get my first e5 clear
[12:39 AM] Byeong Ha: but progging is also an adventure
[12:39 AM] shin (hi): rofl
[12:39 AM] Byeong Ha: of wipe
[12:39 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): But like I said, make the event. If people show up, they will show up. But if it's an event you run the risk of having 12 people show up for something you need 8/16/24/etc for. So one group is gonna be plagued to PF it
[12:39 AM] Jiesus: y'all don't even have to be involved
[12:39 AM] Byeong Ha: idk if you know but i spent a whole month progging a fucking trial ex
[12:39 AM] Jiesus: your SUPPORT would be nice
[12:39 AM] shin (hi): what does that mean
[12:39 AM] Jiesus: your excitement or some sort of positive energy toward the event would be nice
[12:39 AM] Byeong Ha: its like
[12:39 AM] Jiesus: advertise it?
[12:39 AM] Byeong Ha: bot lane shin
[12:40 AM] Byeong Ha: we have adc and support
[12:40 AM] shin (hi): ew
[12:40 AM] Jiesus: encourage ppl to do it?
[12:40 AM] Byeong Ha: we're the support
[12:40 AM] shin (hi): imagine mobas
[12:40 AM] Jiesus: nvm bye
[12:40 AM] Byeong Ha: imagine tho
[12:40 AM] shin (hi): we've done nothing but tell u to go for it
[12:40 AM] shin (hi): jie
[12:40 AM] Byeong Ha: i will encourage your event
[12:40 AM] shin (hi): ^^
[12:40 AM] Byeong Ha: when u make the announcement
[12:41 AM] shin (hi): we were just responding to your comments that you said it seems not many vets want to help out
[12:42 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): We don't even have that many vets in the FC that are even online between tiers
[12:43 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Who in the FC has cleared the tier AND still plays right now? Me, Shin, and Vysis?
[12:43 AM] shin (hi): that's the only ones I know
[12:43 AM] Byeong Ha: i do

[12:43 AM] Byeong Ha: just not e8s
[12:43 AM] shin (hi): and I've only seen vysis levelling for the past weeks
[12:43 AM] Byeong Ha: i kinda play lul
[12:43 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Cause if that's the case, I don't think calling out Vysis for not wanting to help on her own time is a wise choice xD
[12:44 AM] shin (hi): I didn't even know anyone else in the FC raided lol
[12:44 AM] shin (hi): as far as i knew, the majority of people are still working through MSQ
[12:44 AM] Byeong Ha: cuz they are
[12:44 AM] Byeong Ha: lul
[12:44 AM] shin (hi): yea
[12:44 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Chroma and Shelby have cleared but Shelby plays in the opposit 12 hours as the rest of us
[12:44 AM] shin (hi): that's why I never pushed to collect people who wanted to do savage
[12:45 AM] shin (hi): based on the general response when I talk about it
[12:45 AM] Byeong Ha: we used to have a raid team 2
[12:45 AM] shin (hi): or complain about it
[12:45 AM] shin (hi): in fc chat
[12:45 AM] Byeong Ha: that dont play aymore xd
[12:45 AM] shin (hi): :02XD~1:
[12:45 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Not Unique has cleared
[12:45 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Fact is, all but like... 1-2 of our cleared vets already help out
[12:46 AM] shin (hi): yeah we don't mind helping but definitely if there's interest the way to go is organize the people who are showing interest, get a consistent 8, and go for it
[12:46 AM] shin (hi): doing it free form is hella jank
[12:53 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): @Jiesus I'm looking through our members list and all our vets DO help out. Myself, Shin, Byeong, Chroma, Not Unique, Vysis, and Shelby are the only ones that have cleared the tier (or at least E7S).

Excluding Shelby, who plays at night, we've all actively helped those that are trying to clear Eden Savage.

Those like Brosef, Xeno, Tinnor (and the rest of the old FC team) currently aren't playing and they've only beaten E6S.

I understand the frustration, especially since you've been at PF this entire week, but getting upset because the vets aren't helping out much isn't right because all the runs you guys organize have had the vets in them.
[12:55 AM] shin (hi): I ( and Swarles will probably agree) 100% support new players getting into savage. If you want to schedule something regular and get people to commit to showing up regularly, I'm more than willing to help however I can. But, personally, I can't be the one to drive that.
[12:57 AM] shin (hi): From the sound of it, you've found a bunch of people in the FC that also have an interest, so get them together and form a consistent lineup and pick some days to meet. If people have to miss a day for whatever reason, I or Swarles or whoever can probably fill
[12:59 AM] shin (hi): We're not trying to discourage you from going for it, not at all
[12:59 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I also forgot to mention Deo in that list but he's been playing other games for the past few months instead
[1:00 AM] shin (hi): there's other games?
[1:00 AM] shin (hi): :wow~2:
[1:00 AM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): like... 2?
[1:00 AM] shin (hi): i know raiding and diadem
[1:00 AM] shin (hi): that's my two games
[1:00 AM] shin (hi): :02XD~1:
[3:08 AM] Jade (Vysis): @Jiesus Fucking excuse me? You're bitching and complaining that there's not enough vets helping out when you've had Swarles, Shin, Byeong, Not Unique, Chroma, or any combination of them
in EVERY SINGLE run you guys have organized.

I haven't raided in months and I don't plan on raiding until the next tier. At this point you're just calling me out because I didn't help out today. If all the help you've received from 
the vets isn't enough then you're just asking to be carried. Guess what. We didnt have vets helping us.

Finding a static is impossible because no one is raiding this tier anymore. That does not suddenly make it my job to raid with you, especially when there's already a small group of new players raiding together as well as 1-2 vets everytime.

We've already highly encouraged new players to get together and learn. If all of this isn't enough support and "enthusiasm" then this is sad.

I would've been more than happy to help you raid next tier. And now you've pissed me off with this stupidity when I should be asleep. Good luck raiding next tier.
[7:46 PM] Jiesus: Oh.
[7:47 PM] Jiesus: 1) Wasn't my intention to wake you up.
[7:47 PM] Jiesus: 2) Not expecting vets to always join. It would be nice to see encouragement from vets, and possibly provide tips or something. I'm speaking on behalf of other people expressing this to me as well, this isn't just a "me" thing.
[7:48 PM] Jiesus: 3) I really don't appreciate you being so rude and aggressive toward me. Not necessary and really hurtful.
[7:49 PM] Jiesus: I feel as though I was completely misinterpreted and I'm sorry I didn't express things the way I did. And I'm sorry I got frustrated, which is why I dropped the topic because I don't know how to express exactly what I intend to.
[8:08 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Everything you said sounded entitled. You pretty much said said "vets don't help me. I wanna make an event to make them help me" even though every single run organized by you guys has had vets helping and teaching you all.

We spent 32 minutes being nice to you, telling you that we DO help every single time while also explaining that making an event to try to FORCE us to do something that we're already doing isn't gonna work. We tried to tell you this numerous times.

When I told you that even if you made an event for it there's a chance people won't show up, yet you seemed to get offended by that statement. You yourself don't even show up to all FC events. We get that you were frustrated but you called everyone of the vets out in this chat. You don't seem to understand that teaching and progging savage raids is WORK. Work that we've been doing for EIGHT MONTHS STRAIGHT for 4-8 hours PER DAY. You wiped 50 times on E5S before getting your clear? We wiped 100 times each day before getting our clears because we had 30 ilvl less than you. We didn't have vets helping us. We didn't have guides. We had trial and error. We put in our blood, sweat, and tears into clearing it for ourselves and we are still progging it to this day to help you guys get your clears. Yet you (and by the sounds of it, other people) are apparently ungrateful for that.
[8:09 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): If what you said was misinterpreted then you should re-explain yourself because I'm pretty sure everyone in this chat interpreted what you said in the exact same way.
[8:18 PM] shin (hi): to put it into perspective a bit, when you say stuff like:
i know many of you have retired this tier 3 months ago or whatever but it's getting disheartening to see ppl not want to help people catch up
it definitely feels like you're calling us out as if we're trying to keep new players down, but there's a big difference between helping explain mechanics if you get stuck or giving advice/answers to specific questions, and just straight up doing it for you, which, at least from my perspective, kinda felt like what you were asking for
[8:20 PM] shin (hi): like, if you ever have any questions like "what am I supposed to do in X situation" or "how is x mechanic supposed to work" or stuff like that, I'm sure all of us are more than happy to answer that. but if you're just wanting generic advice and shit, then like... literally the only generic advice is "hit a training dummy for 30-60 minutes every day" and "do more pulls"
[8:20 PM] shin (hi): like, this is what my day 1 of this tier looked like:

[8:21 PM] shin (hi): you just have to do it
8:23 PM] shin (hi): and yeah, this was all in PF, and PF sucks and the people that play in it suck and are toxic, but that kinda just comes with the multiplayer experience. The only answer is putting a static group together and pruning out the people that don't fit/don't carry their weight. Which is a lot of work, admittedly. The price of PF convenience is dealing with people who don't know what they're doing and you're not sure if they can even spell their own names
[8:23 PM] shin (hi): Hi Raithe long time no see
[8:23 PM] shin (hi): :waveKP:
[8:24 PM] shin (hi): hope you've been well
[8:24 PM] Raithe: I'm always here, just lurking xD
[8:24 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): Even when we were progging with our Static, which included Jade, Raithe, Deo, Shin, and myself, every single day we progged looked like the pic Shin posted.
[8:24 PM] shin (hi): god we spent eons on 6 it felt like
[8:25 PM] shin (hi): and we weren't even doing it blind
[8:26 PM] Jiesus: i just wish i didn't say anything
[8:26 PM] Raithe: Neither were we, it sucked.
[8:26 PM] Jiesus: and i'm really sorry
[8:26 PM] Jiesus: i didn't want to upset anybody
[8:26 PM] Jiesus: or guilt anybody
[8:26 PM] Jiesus: and idk how to reconcile
[8:27 PM] Jiesus: i just feel really bad and i fucked up and idk what to do about it
[8:29 PM] Raithe: Well since this is ffxiv, the Japanese would have had you do seppuku but I doubt anyone wants you to do anything so harsh
[8:29 PM] SwarlesBarkley (Aurk): I'm not asking you to apologize. I just want you to understand that we're helping out as much as we can when we are available and up for it but quite frankly, re-progging this tier is like continuing to stuff your face full of food after you've already thrown up twice because you ate too much.
