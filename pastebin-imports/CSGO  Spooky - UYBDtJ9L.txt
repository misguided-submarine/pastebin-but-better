7:07 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: hmm.
7:09 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: is this the part where you sit around wondering what to do
7:10 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: no i am reminiscing
7:10 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: ?
7:10 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: check discord
7:10 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: the chronic tab
7:10 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: chronic tab is for babies
7:11 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: yes but i figured if i posted that in the main one id get flamed lol
7:11 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: ???
7:11 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: what
7:11 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: i figured you guys werent into that kinda a thing soi was like meh they wont understand anyways
7:12 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: what
7:12 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: do u know who cliff burton is
7:12 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: you should really stop categorizing people baselessly
7:12 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: they don't like it
7:13 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: uh well it wasnt completely baseless, from what i understand metallica isnt in your guys' list of good music
7:13 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: what
7:13 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: once again
7:13 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: 1: baseless and 2: irrelevant
7:14 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: well #2 is exactly why i didnt post it in main channel, it was relevent to you guys or video games so i put it in the chronic where like no one looks anyways xd
7:14 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: no u idiot
7:14 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: whether we like Metallica or not is irrelevant
7:14 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: also because i think ive talked to msot of you about musical interest and i think pizza was the only one who liked metallica xd
7:14 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: okay so what's my musical interests
7:14 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: go
7:15 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: like everything you hardly specified but i believe you mentioned you didnt like things like thrash metal and stuff which is what old metallica is
7:15 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: there should be a comma after everything
7:15 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: so you really don't know
7:15 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: lol
7:15 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: like
7:15 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: sihh
7:15 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: sigh
7:16 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: you can post whatever the fuck you want in my discord
7:16 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: no because you didnt specify other than you didnt like thrash and stuff
7:16 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: I don't even know what thrash is
7:16 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: but that doesn't mean I don't care about people dying
7:16 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: like
7:16 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: what
7:16 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: i mean he didnt die recently
7:16 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: which is why it was very irrelevent
7:16 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: so
7:16 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: he died long time ago
7:16 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: who cares
7:18 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: half the shit that we talk about is just as asinine
7:18 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: yes but mostly relatable to at least one other person in the chat
7:18 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: not always
7:18 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: that was like hardly relateable to any of you based on my understanding
7:18 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: except you have no clue
7:19 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: you just assume
7:19 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: which is why i posted it in chronic rather than not posting it in discord at all xd
7:19 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: so everyone could see
7:19 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: okay chronic
7:19 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: isn't a channel
7:19 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: so that maybe someone in the thing could relate
7:19 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: like that's what I'm saying
7:19 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: literally no one looks at that channel
7:20 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: welp never mind time to delete
7:20 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: I have lots of artists that I liked
7:20 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: that died
7:20 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: of course I can relate
7:23 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: its not as relateable to people who dont know cliff burton though because he isnt a known artist these days because he died really early in his career like 10 years before any of us were born roughly
7:23 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: like yea its relatable when its a really known person who dies
7:23 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: especially someone who lived during our generation
7:24 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: like Tom Petty
7:24 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: we can all relate to his death
7:24 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: but people dont care about the deaths of people before we were born unless they knew him for something prior to it
7:25 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: its like saying wow elvis died
7:25 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: like
7:25 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: yea
7:25 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: a long time ago
7:25 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: ????
7:25 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: so?
7:25 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: but elvis fans would be like
7:25 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: yea
7:25 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: they would relate to that
7:27 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: and the only people who really can relate to cliff burton's death were people who at least lived during that time period and heard about it or people who are really big fans of metallica and followed their history which if any of you were you would have explicitly stated you were like i have but the only one to come close out of all of you ive talked to about music was pizza and he also wasnt like that big of a fan of metallica enough to know about him and i think i even talked to pizza about him like a while ago
7:28 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: do you think that the only thing people talk about is stuff they already know
7:29 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: half the conversations I have are because I said something or someone else said something and the other person didn't know about it
7:29 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: boom
7:29 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: easy as fuck conversation
7:30 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: except its still typically based off some vague mutual interest known
7:30 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: or without some vague information known
7:32 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: like i dont just say randomly in discord "i told howard about the shading shit diane has been up to lately"
7:32 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: because none of you have any prior information to relate to that or know wtf im talking about
7:32 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: itd be another thing however if ive told you about my work experiences before
7:33 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: like im sure you can go back to like every fresh conversation you started in discord and connect that with some kind of relevant information or mutual interest
7:33 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: whether it be
7:34 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: dowa
7:34 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: dota
7:34 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: or anime
7:34 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: or ashley
7:34 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: or the the work stuff youve talkked about in the past
7:34 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: or your parents
7:34 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: or bani's boyfriend jeff
7:35 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: cause otherwise people are like "????? okay" and dont really care
7:35 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: no
7:35 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: people don't do that
7:35 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: lol what
7:36 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: like if you say something random
7:36 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: they have in my experience
7:36 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: and we say ?
7:36 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: that's asking you to explain wtf you're talking about
7:36 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: not telling you to go away lol
7:37 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: I'm not sure I'd trust your experience since you're demonstrably bad at reading people
7:37 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: eh w.e point taken i wanna play dota or smth now
7:38 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: i gotta take medication first tho

10:21 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: brood war and sc2
10:21 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: that's bullshit

10:21 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: moving on now
10:21 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: well true to the genre
10:21 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: there is nothing else
10:22 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: like the only other rts games out there arent really rts games
10:22 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: the latest warhammer 40k was more of a moba
10:22 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: it was real bad
10:23 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: tooth and tail is a very over simplified version of an rts
10:23 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: not very fun
10:23 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: those are like the only other 2
10:27 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: so like I said
10:27 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: you just find ways that everything is bad
10:27 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: dota is good game, i just cant deal with the loses personally
10:28 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: my nature is terrible for team games
10:28 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: I call bullshit
10:28 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: how so
10:29 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: I'm not explaining it again
10:29 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: "i find every excuse to say something is bad"
10:29 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: i just want my games back
10:29 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: i want age of empires and command and conquer
10:29 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: people still play those I'm sure
10:29 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: but moba and their respective companies killed them
10:30 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: actually the command and conquer servers are inactive
10:30 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: you can only play lan
10:30 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: so find people that play it
10:30 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: wat
10:30 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: its
10:30 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: lan
10:30 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: SO
10:30 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: FIND
10:30 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: local network only
10:30 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: PEOPLE
10:31 PM - ℱᗩﬡᑕᎩ: actually nevermind you'll figure it out when you finally decide you want to do something other than complain
10:31 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: i just dont understand what you mean unless im using wrong word
10:31 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: you can only play with people on your network, like your router, in your house
10:32 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: and age of empires doesnt really have a competitive scene anymore even though their servers are still active
10:33 PM - -DI- A Random Badger: because people moved onto moba or sc
