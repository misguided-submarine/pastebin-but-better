[1:46 AM]
공상:
	I have a question

[1:46 AM]
Pizza:
	go for it

[1:46 AM]
공상:
	when you make midas
	is it because
	you don't know what item you're supposed to buy
	or because you think you can get away with it
	or because
	uh
	idn
	I'm out of reasons

[1:47 AM]
Pizza:
	it's a littlle of those reasons, but i think that game it made enough sense

[1:47 AM]
공상:
	it did not

[1:47 AM]
Pizza:
	if i was a 3 what else would i do
	i was like
	lowest level
	and no farm
	and where would i farm anyways

[1:47 AM]
공상:
	but your hero
	isn't designed to farm

[1:47 AM]
Pizza:
	like i don't need to blink jump something because you can just blink jump something

[1:47 AM]
공상:
	what
	I can't go first
	in fights
	ever

[1:48 AM]
Pizza:
	but i'm talking at like 16 minutes

[1:48 AM]
공상:
	I can only pick people off with blink

[1:48 AM]
Pizza:
	if i blink dismember something it gets canceled pretty quicly

[1:48 AM]
공상:
	ya but then you're tanking spells
	and then I can do things

[1:48 AM]
Pizza:
	also morph linkens befor ei had midas
	also I tank like a frost blast and an open wounds

[1:48 AM]
공상:
	I just don't think it ever makes sense to buy that item
	it doesn't pay for itself for ten minutes
	and that's if you use it off cd
	and then you get an extra like 150 gold every minute
	or something
	135
	idr
	math
	like it actually makes the game really hard to play I think
	because your hero is just missing net worth
	for a really really long time
	lik even in that game I was reallys cared
	to ever go on people

[1:51 AM]
Pizza:
	i just have no clue what i buy that changes anything that game

[1:51 AM]
공상:
	unless I can see wd
	and lich

[1:51 AM]
Pizza:
	like sooner vessel?

[1:51 AM]
공상:
	blink

[1:51 AM]
Pizza:
	doesn't really helpo meepo

[1:51 AM]
공상:
	so u can start things
	like

[1:51 AM]
Pizza:
	i just land hooks to start things that game

[1:51 AM]
공상:
	u don't need to buy things
	to help the meepo
	u buy things to
	do things without meepo
	so meepo can do his things
	cus like if you just always die instatenly

[1:51 AM]
Pizza:
	still think that makes more sense if we had an actual 3

[1:51 AM]
공상:
	or can't start or catch without meepo
	then meepo can't play game either
	and this applies to like
	non meepo games too
	like in this game if you just have like a force and a blink
	u can help spectre not feed to naix
	and u can also make plays

[1:52 AM]
Pizza:
	i was never with yoshi

[1:52 AM]
공상:
	yeah but u should have been

[1:52 AM]
Pizza:
	but i don't think he was getting ganked after that

[1:53 AM]
공상:
	wat
	no u play with im
	him

[1:53 AM]
Pizza:
	*after laning phase

[1:53 AM]
공상:
	and start thigns
	so I can go in after

[1:53 AM]
Pizza:
	his opijnion was for him to be on one side and i be with you
	one sid eof the map

[1:53 AM]
공상:
	wat

[1:53 AM]
Pizza:
	he said that

[1:53 AM]
공상:
	that was wrong then

[1:53 AM]
Pizza:
	like twice in the game

[1:53 AM]
공상:
	meepo changes things

[1:53 AM]
Pizza:
	and you guys know more so

[1:53 AM]
공상:
	like u really need to be able to
	do things
	well
	specifically for meepo
	u have to be able to do things
	take fights and etc

[1:54 AM]
Pizza:
	i did do things even after midas tho that's what i'm not understanding

[1:54 AM]
공상:
	without him

[1:54 AM]
Pizza:
	we did a lot in the mid game
	we literally jsut threw at the end

[1:54 AM]
공상:
	not really
	we kinda threw
	a lot
	like I had that
	fight
	near their ancients
	where I was just
	in there

[1:55 AM]
Pizza:
	oh yeah btw

[1:55 AM]
공상:
	and I shouldn't have been

[1:55 AM]
Pizza:
	i said like

[1:55 AM]
공상:
	that was oof

[1:55 AM]
Pizza:
	1 second b efore wd ulted
	that yoshi needed to get out of way
	and he did not
	so wd got full ult
	and i hooke d him instead

[1:55 AM]
공상:
	wat if u have blink and force tho xd

[1:55 AM]
Pizza:
	uhhhhhhh it's already canceled because if you recall i started that fight with hooking naix

[1:55 AM]
공상:
	also regardless lock shana is bad
	shaman*
	don't think shaman can 4

[1:55 AM]
Pizza:
	already disabled by the maledict

[1:55 AM]
공상:
	but that's whatever

[1:56 AM]
Pizza:
	so i didn't have blink anyways lol
	also hook doesn't happen uniless i have aether lens lul

[1:56 AM]
공상:
	ya but
	well

[1:56 AM]
Pizza:
	and if you think blinking uphill was play, there was 0 followup at that distance

[1:56 AM]
공상:
	that fight
	was mostly on me

[1:56 AM]
Pizza:
	he was like
	on shrine side of ancients

[1:56 AM]
공상:
	cus I shoulda just
	not gone
	I think not fighting
	was the play
	tbh

[1:56 AM]
Pizza:
	i think

[1:56 AM]
공상:
	cus I can't fight there

[1:56 AM]
Pizza:
	letting me cancel wd aghs ult was play

[1:56 AM]
공상:
	I don't think
	that's correct
	I think
	not fighting there
	is correct

[1:56 AM]
Pizza:
	it's like 450 physical per second

[1:56 AM]
공상:
	I think I let u hook naix and then I let him walk aay
	okay but it also doesn't go off
	if I don't fight
	lol

[1:57 AM]
Pizza:
	and we get nothing if we don't fight

[1:57 AM]
공상:
	like I die no matter what
	what
	why would we fight there
	it's super bad for me

[1:57 AM]
Pizza:
	yeah but losing meepo but killing 4 others is pretty dank

[1:57 AM]
공상:
	not rlly

[1:57 AM]
Pizza:
	why noit

[1:57 AM]
공상:
	how do u take buildings
	if I'm dead
	?

[1:57 AM]
Pizza:
	we still have a spec to carry
	also shaman wards

[1:57 AM]
공상:
	100%
	bad fight
	I'm sure
	of this
	like maybe if I let u all
	tank some shit
	but me going on naix
	I think is never right
	think that only goes bad
	for me
	but ya that fight was whatever i threw
	the disengage from top rax was also
	highly suspect
	idn what was happening there
	but ya like in both games
	there's
	2 heroes I needed disabled to fight
	and we just didn't have the ability to go on them
	which was really bad
[2:00 AM]
Pizza:
	yeah uhh
	idk if you saw
	that one fight where
	'everyone died
	julian just died bc julian dies
	but yoshi uhh

[2:00 AM]
공상:
	I'm sure u all just stood in shrapnel
	and died

[2:00 AM]
Pizza:
	did not hit bkb
	so he lost mana
	and didn't reincarnate
	so he just died lol

[2:00 AM]
공상:
	what did he lose mana too idr what was in that game

[2:00 AM]
Pizza:
	emp
	invoker

[2:00 AM]
공상:
	o ya
	that's a spell
	fuck fighting that hero actually
	db is stupid

[2:01 AM]
Pizza:

	see you on sunday

[2:01 AM]
