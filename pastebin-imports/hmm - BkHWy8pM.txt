[1:02 PM] pizza: so any thoughts or response?
[1:04 PM] fancy: I don't really know because you kinda just told me things I already knew
[1:05 PM] fancy: I do think that outbursts stem from something that part of you actually believes
[1:08 PM] fancy: Like I've been mad at you plenty of times but I never throw things at you that I don't believe just because I'm mad
[1:08 PM] fancy: So I'm inclined to think that's how most people would operate
[1:56 PM] pizza: I'm sorry about those impulse reactions
[1:56 PM] fancy: I get that you're sorry
[1:56 PM] fancy: But that wasn't the point
[1:57 PM] pizza: I get that too
[4:26 PM] fancy: that's a really un-reassuring answer
[4:30 PM] fancy: Because that either means you understand my point but don't agree with it, or that you do agree with it. Which would mean that you acknowledge that you do still think that the things you said are true
[4:32 PM] pizza: i don't get what you mean by the escond option
[4:32 PM] fancy: So
[4:32 PM] fancy: by saying you "get" my point
[4:32 PM] fancy: which was that
[4:33 PM] fancy: the insults that people throw aren't usually completely reasonless, but usually originate from something that they believe to be true
[4:33 PM] fancy: you're either saying
[4:34 PM] fancy: you understand what my point was, but you don't actually agree that it's sound
[4:34 PM] fancy: or
[4:34 PM] fancy: that you understand what my point was, and you agree that it's sound
[4:34 PM] fancy: which necessarily confirms that the things you said were things that some part of you believes
[4:51 PM] pizza: it's the second one
[4:51 PM] fancy: yea
[4:51 PM] pizza: and while it was some thing that part of me believed, i hadn't ever really thought about it
[4:51 PM] fancy: thus why I said it wasn't very reassuring
[4:52 PM] pizza: which i addressed in the letter
[4:52 PM] pizza: it was a residual feeling from the past few years
[4:52 PM] pizza: even if you've been more forward and more willing to reach out, the context of the time when you just wouldn't say anything is still there
[4:52 PM] fancy: I've always believed that if someone wants to talk about something, they'll talk about it
[4:54 PM] pizza: I think that's pretty unrealistic. so many people commit suicide or attempt it simply bc no one talked to them or reached out
[4:54 PM] fancy: I don't want to be asked what's wrong while I'm still upset so I don't ask other people
[4:54 PM] pizza: yeah, and that's you.
[4:54 PM] pizza: a lot of people aren't like that
[4:54 PM] pizza: i wouldn't say most
[4:54 PM] pizza: but a lot
[4:54 PM] fancy: But a lot of people will respect being asked not to ask about it
[4:55 PM] fancy: I don't think I'm obligated to reach out if I'm not the one with the issue
[4:55 PM] fancy: or anyone for that matter
[4:55 PM] pizza: I wouldn't say that you're obligated or that anyone is
[4:55 PM] pizza: we had this talk a few months ago
[4:55 PM] pizza: that it's an unrealistic expectation
[4:55 PM] pizza: but i go off of my experience
[4:55 PM] pizza: how i've reached out to people
[4:56 PM] pizza: and people have appreciated it and reciprocate
[4:56 PM] fancy: If you buy someone lunch, most will appreciate it, and many would reciprocate
[4:56 PM] fancy: I don't see your point
[4:56 PM] pizza: but i don't expect it anymore anyways
[4:57 PM] pizza: my point was simply that i go off of my past experience
[4:57 PM] pizza: and what people that i grew up with and spent time with appreciated
[4:57 PM] pizza: and those experiences shaped who I am and what my tastes are
[4:57 PM] pizza: and that you do the same thing based on your experiences and preferences
[4:57 PM] pizza: i don't think either of us is wrong for reaching out or not
[4:57 PM] fancy: that's not true because you've taken issue with it
[4:57 PM] pizza: i think i was wrong to criticize you for not doing it
[4:57 PM] fancy: so clearly you feel negatively about it
[4:57 PM] pizza: yes, and i think i was worng for doing that
[4:58 PM] fancy: maybe
[4:58 PM] fancy: idn
[4:58 PM] pizza: it's not my preference so i held that against you
[4:58 PM] fancy: that I could believe
[4:58 PM] pizza: when really you are you and i am me and there's no right or wrong with that
[4:58 PM] fancy: also true
[4:59 PM] fancy: in general
[5:04 PM] fancy: maybe you haven't had enough experience or the right experience, but I feel like it's not unrealistic to consider that if everyone relies on the same person to take care of stuff indefinitetly, that person might get tired of it eventually
[5:04 PM] fancy: sorta like taking your parents for granted
[5:06 PM] fancy: hell even Julian started to get annoyed at me having to tell everyone the console command every time we played versus
[5:09 PM] fancy: I don't really think I've ever expressed an enjoyment about being in charge except maybe the one about hosting in csgo
[5:10 PM] fancy: though part of that was my internet/pc being the best at that point I think, in addition to the ping thing lol
[5:11 PM] fancy: but yes, a lot of other things were driven by everyone else's apparent inability to figure out how to do it or problem solve anything that came up
[5:11 PM] fancy: which was even more frustrating because I refuse to believe I'm any more competent than the rest of you
[5:11 PM] fancy: so that only leaves laziness/not caring as an explanation
[5:31 PM] pizza: ye I was talking to badger about this yesterday I believe
[5:31 PM] pizza: he was saying something about how you're always the first to make something so no one else does bc of that, but that's not relaly true
[5:31 PM] pizza: that last time we did tabletop there were like 5 of us sitting around wiating for you
[5:31 PM] pizza: and then you joined and still had to make the room
[5:32 PM] fancy: Yes
[5:32 PM] fancy: I was in bed
[5:32 PM] fancy: got out of bed cus ppl said they were here to play
5:32 PM] pizza: and had to get up and make everything still
[5:32 PM] fancy: and then I had to do everything
[5:32 PM] fancy: and THEN
[5:32 PM] fancy: people weren't even ready to join
[5:33 PM] fancy: that's when I told Nikki I was just gonna go get back in bed
[5:33 PM] fancy: and then it was another 5-10 minutes before she messaged me that people were here now
[6:22 PM] pizza: are you gonna be on for dota tonight
[6:22 PM] pizza: *before 3am
[6:37 PM] fancy: unsure
[6:37 PM] fancy: why
[6:39 PM] pizza: bc i wanted to play party dota
[6:39 PM] fancy: I'm sure Nikki will be around
[6:39 PM] fancy: and Yoshi maybe
[6:39 PM] pizza: yes
[6:39 PM] pizza: and nikki picked techies
[6:39 PM] fancy: you and I don't want to play the same game anyway
[6:39 PM] pizza: i don't think that's very true
[6:39 PM] fancy: you said it yourself
[6:40 PM] pizza: i get something different from it than you do from different things in the game
[6:40 PM] fancy: just because you rephrase it more charitably doesn't change the idea behind it lol
[6:41 PM] pizza: what, playing to win and have fun while doing it?
[6:41 PM] pizza: pretty sure that sums up anyone you play with too
[6:42 PM] pizza: it's not like you don't random sometimes
[6:42 PM] pizza: not like nikki doesn't pick techies sometimes
[6:42 PM] pizza: or yoshi picks meme offlane or support bc he saw a pro do it
[6:42 PM] pizza: sometimes it feels like you think i don't care about winning and that i have like a 30% winrate bc of the way I play or something
[6:43 PM] pizza: that's at least the impression get from you
[6:43 PM] fancy: you'd rather lose 25% more often than play a hero you don't like
[6:43 PM] fancy: that's very different from me
[6:44 PM] fancy: nikkis the one that picks some really meme 5's more than Yoshi does
[6:44 PM] fancy: you'd have to give an example
[6:45 PM] pizza: wait, an example of yoshi just picking something bc he feels like playing it or bc he saw something played and he did it?
[6:47 PM] fancy: some real meme pick he did
[6:47 PM] fancy: yeah
[6:49 PM] fancy: Oh lol
[6:49 PM] pizza: ?
[6:49 PM] fancy: this techies pick was with jungle wisp, Tyler AND casta
[6:49 PM] fancy: yeah you weren't winning this game
[6:49 PM] pizza: it wasn't jungle wisp we lane swapped
[6:50 PM] fancy: what
[6:50 PM] pizza: game prob thinks wisp jungled or something
[6:50 PM] pizza: bc we switched lanes like twice
[6:50 PM] fancy: no
[6:50 PM] fancy: aku plays
[6:50 PM] fancy: jungle wisp
[6:50 PM] fancy: that's just what he does
[6:50 PM] fancy: at some point during 50% of games you just wonder "where is my wisp player" and he's jungling the triangle alone
[6:50 PM] fancy: that's aku
[6:50 PM] fancy: jungle wisp
[6:51 PM] pizza: hold on
[6:51 PM] pizza: so is picking techies and going afk justified bc aku tyler and casta were there
[6:51 PM] fancy: yes
[6:51 PM] pizza: okay
[6:51 PM] pizza: so
[6:51 PM] fancy: ur not winning that game
[6:52 PM] pizza: why queue for a game you're 100% going to lose
[6:52 PM] pizza: if your goal is to win
[6:52 PM] fancy: I try not to but I don't control who Nikki invites
[6:52 PM] fancy: also I probably would have dodged that stack
[6:52 PM] fancy: unless I was in a super good mood and felt like I was playing well that day
[6:53 PM] fancy: it's not 100% to lose just like 85%
[6:53 PM] fancy: the goon to non goon ratio is way too high
[6:56 PM] fancy: I random when I decided not to care about the game cus I'm either in too poor a mood to try super hard, or I'm too tired or Nikki badgered me in to playing even if I didn't really want to
[6:57 PM] fancy: I don't usually have a problem with Yoshi's picks
[6:57 PM] fancy: he picks stuns
[6:57 PM] fancy: xd
[6:57 PM] fancy: and abaddon
[6:57 PM] fancy: A+ for me
[6:57 PM] pizza: I still don't see how that's a valid excuse but wanting to try different off-meta heroes is inexcusable
[6:57 PM] pizza: yeah i saw that winstreak
6:57 PM] fancy: if he could just take high school geometry and learn about straight lines
[6:57 PM] fancy: life would be good
[6:57 PM] pizza: you mean for like
[6:57 PM] pizza: skillshots?
[6:58 PM] fancy: pudge
[6:58 PM] fancy: we lose to pudge
[6:58 PM] pizza: oph
[6:58 PM] fancy: not even pudge players
[6:58 PM] fancy: just pudge
[6:58 PM] fancy: the concept
[6:58 PM] fancy: of straight lines
[6:58 PM] fancy: eludes us
[6:58 PM] pizza: yeahyoshi had the same magnet that julian has installed in his asshole
[6:59 PM] fancy: but yeah
[6:59 PM] fancy: also what
[6:59 PM] fancy: you don't see how picking stuns is different from wanting to try random shit ?
[7:01 PM] pizza: idk if abaddon and bristle count as picking stuns
[7:02 PM] fancy: :nikkiHanh:
[7:02 PM] fancy: idr the last time he picked bristle
[7:02 PM] pizza: he did pick it twice in the last month, just something i saw at a glance
[7:03 PM] fancy: and yeah abaddon isn't a stun it also owns
[7:03 PM] fancy: was it in my games lol
[7:03 PM] pizza: don't think so
[7:03 PM] fancy: :nikkiHmm:
[7:03 PM] fancy: okaaaaay
[7:09 PM] fancy: So I still don't understand your point
[7:14 PM] fancy:

[7:15 PM] fancy: Yoshi picks in my games
[7:15 PM] fancy: I see only stuns and saves
[7:15 PM] fancy: and 1 furion xd
[7:15 PM] fancy: so idk wat u bring up Yoshi for
[7:16 PM] fancy: cus idk how this is same as off meta heroes
[11:52 PM] fancy: :nikkiHmm:
[11:52 PM] pizza: what
[11:53 PM] fancy: uhhh
[11:53 PM] fancy: I mean
[11:53 PM] fancy: ok i guess if u were done with that conversation earlier... ?
[5:29 PM] pizza: I don't think I have anything else to say worth saying
[5:37 PM] fancy: oh ok
[5:38 PM] pizza: I've thought about it for a while
[5:38 PM] pizza: and if you don't want to play with me then I can't change that
[5:38 PM] fancy: that's not quite what I said
[5:39 PM] pizza: I mean, you can phrase it however you want. You can say it's not that you don't want to play with me, but that we play different games. It's all the same really, just with more specificity as to why
[5:40 PM] fancy: well no they're still very different
[5:40 PM] fancy: I still wish you'd want to play the same games as I do
[5:41 PM] fancy: but if you don't want to then when can I do about that
[5:41 PM] pizza: I mean, I think I do
[5:41 PM] fancy: I only brought it up again because you were asking when I was gonna be home
[5:41 PM] pizza: I've been asking nikki for advice after each game
[5:41 PM] pizza: about what would have been better pick
[5:41 PM] pizza: and build
[5:41 PM] pizza: and she's more than willing to explain and help
[5:41 PM] pizza: you can ask her if you want
[5:42 PM] pizza: i used to do that for you, but you expressed how you got very tired of doing that
[5:42 PM] pizza: of 'playing people's game for them
[5:42 PM] pizza: which i get
[5:42 PM] pizza: but i have been taking considerable effort to play more seriously
[5:42 PM] pizza: with more serious item builds
[5:42 PM] pizza: and i've been working towards learning more about the game
[5:42 PM] pizza: it's why i got calibrated in ranked
[5:42 PM] pizza: or watch dotaalchemy videos
[5:42 PM] pizza: or got a month of gameleap
[5:44 PM] fancy: I don't care if you ask after the game
[5:45 PM] fancy: Nikki and I do movie night like every night
[5:45 PM] fancy: and we watch our games
[5:45 PM] fancy: and talk about what went wrong
[5:45 PM] pizza: oh lol
[5:45 PM] pizza: i thought that was just more
[5:45 PM] pizza: "hey look how dum this was"
[5:45 PM] fancy: there's some of that too
[5:45 PM] fancy: depends on how the games have gone
[5:45 PM] fancy: sometimes one of us throws
[5:45 PM] pizza: at least that's what i got from the times where i would tune into your stream for 20 seconds xd
[5:46 PM] fancy: but that doesn't change that you don't really want to ever learn meta heroes or whatever
[5:46 PM] fancy: like you're never gonna spam magnus
[5:46 PM] fancy: or razor
[5:46 PM] fancy: or abaddon
[5:47 PM] fancy: like the very fact that you would ever say that
[5:48 PM] fancy: you'd take a 15% lower winrate if it meant you got to play a hero that's "more fun"
[5:48 PM] fancy: is an illustration of that
5:48 PM] pizza: i believe the superlative was 'hero that is fun always' vs 'never ever playing a hero i enjoy again'
[5:48 PM] pizza: which is pretty extreme lol
[5:49 PM] pizza: i think if that hypothetical could be applied to reality, i'd have a way lower winrate
[5:49 PM] fancy: well it can I don't see how it can't be
[5:52 PM] fancy: but now you're just walking back what your argument was the other day
[5:52 PM] fancy: this was your comparison not mine
[5:58 PM] fancy: like there's nothing wrong with that
[5:58 PM] fancy: it is what it is
[5:58 PM] fancy: but call a spade a spade
