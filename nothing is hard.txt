[3:30 AM] shin: this unironically sounds similar to things ive mentioned before
[3:30 AM] polaris: so true
[8:32 AM] Lin: Like that time you said you loved healing L50 synced bahamut, for the complexity?
[8:43 AM] Lin: Having an objectively bad design just to gatekeep bad players sounds like babies and bathwater. Folks keep mixing up “jank” with “subtle and brilliant”.
[8:44 AM] Lin: Best just renounce humanity, return to runescape at that point
[8:51 AM] Lin: I’d agree mapping gcd heals is more satisfying than mapping ogcds, and fights that force healing and ease off on dps checks whereby you can afford the gcds, like an ult, are satisfying — like ults can be.
[8:53 AM] Lin: Pretty sure Darl would look at tweets like that and flip the table in memory of synced tank and blu tank jank, where vit pots being unironically in the rotation just the start of the rage.
[10:31 AM] Lin: Maybe part of it is folks drilling current jobs so much that synced jobs feel fresh, different — bonus, the incomplete rotations haven’t been publicly optimized, so they get to feel it out for themselves.
[10:35 AM] Lin: I tried looking into potency-per-second or total potency sims, apparently the battle log data isn’t complete enough for it to be more than an approximation, something mainly useful to compare yourself against yourself with a fixed comp maybe. But so much vitriol against people asking for it — “if you want to optimize, just compare your gcds against the 100% parser”. Am sure that’s how the 100% did it, crit farm memes aside. /s
[10:37 AM] Lin: Apparently act used to have or has a vestigial pps column, but they’re looking to nuke it with prejudice going into 6.0. sad.
[11:53 AM] shin: Level 50 you have 1 button
[11:53 AM] shin: unironically a single button
[11:57 AM] shin: doing level 60 content was honestly not that bad
[11:57 AM] shin: you actually have some tools then
[11:58 AM] shin: at 50 it's literally med2 and c3
[11:58 AM] shin: you don't have a single healing ogcd
[11:59 AM] shin: except bene maybe
[11:59 AM] shin: that might be what you get at 50
[12:00 PM] shin: idk why we're talking about gatekeeping bad players
[12:01 PM] shin: bad players gatekeep themselves by being lazy and/or ignorant
[12:01 PM] shin: I literally do not care about them
[12:02 PM] shin: don't care if the ever succeed at content, get to experience everything in this game, or even have a fulfilling life in general
[12:02 PM] shin: just want to make that clear
[12:04 PM] shin: blue tank until recently was literally the same boat as level 50 whm, where you had literally one defensive button
[12:04 PM] shin: it crosses back over the line where limitations made you think back into where it's just not fun again
[12:05 PM] Lin: Maybe. I can find a zen in it. BLU healing is nearly the same.
[12:06 PM] shin: blu healing at least had 3 heals
[12:06 PM] shin: even before recently
[12:06 PM] shin: imagine if every problem had to be solved with white wind
[12:06 PM] shin: not fun
[12:07 PM] Lin: Most blu healing in something like a8s doesn’t involve white wind
[12:07 PM] shin: that's not the point
[12:07 PM] shin: the point was if it was actually like what Blu tanking was, you'd have only white wind
[12:08 PM] shin: and that's it
[12:08 PM] shin: or only pom cure
[12:08 PM] shin: or only exuviation
[12:08 PM] Lin: Blu tanking does have buttons now, they’re just overly tied to the gcd cast
[12:08 PM] shin: yes I said this
[12:08 PM] Lin: Hence yes, jank beyond the pale
[12:09 PM] Lin: Blu healing has a comparable number of buttons to L50 healing
[12:09 PM] shin: not anymore
[12:10 PM] shin: plus white wind is infinitely more interesting than med2 or c3
[12:10 PM] Lin: Pom, gobskin, angel snack cooldown, exuv, stotram
[12:10 PM] Lin: exuv generally not that useful , you’d use white wind in most exuv situations
[12:11 PM] Lin: Considering blu encompasses both whm and, say, sch, it’s comparable
[12:11 PM] Lin: White wind has cute snapshot games to it
[12:12 PM] Lin: And can offload work to dps or tanks, plus nice emnity
[12:12 PM] shin: hell the fact that angels snack has a cooldown makes it more interesting than med2
[12:12 PM] Lin: Clearly we need med2 on a cooldown
[12:12 PM] Lin: If only to stop people from spamming it
[12:12 PM] shin: plus what you said about outsourcing some healing to dps or tanks
[12:13 PM] shin: it's actually more things to manage than 50 whm
[12:13 PM] shin: 50 whm has 1 cd and it's bene
[12:13 PM] Lin: Blu is both/all healers, it’s gonna have more buttons than the least buttony healer
[12:14 PM] shin: obviously
[12:14 PM] shin: and thus more interesting
[12:15 PM] shin: which kinda just illustrates my point even more
[12:15 PM] shin: having some tools makes you think
[12:15 PM] shin: having every tool becomes boring again
[12:15 PM] Lin: Depends on how many tools you're required to use
[12:16 PM] Lin: Ultimate eats all of them, even at 80
[12:16 PM] Lin: Savage past week one physically can't, by the design principle of letting healers be capable of / enjoy salvaging suboptimal play
[12:17 PM] shin: I don't like that you equate "suboptimal" with "bad" play
[12:17 PM] shin: getting hit by mechanics isn't sub optimal, it's bad
[12:18 PM] shin: not mitigating properly isn't sub optimal
[12:18 PM] shin: it's bad
[12:18 PM] Lin: People make mistakes. The game is all about 10 minute dances
[12:18 PM] shin: even in week 1 you can make mistakes you just can't make 20
[12:18 PM] Lin: You're going too far on black and white when your standard for the boundary from good to bad sits on speed runs or healer parse runs
[12:19 PM] shin: that's not my standard what
[12:19 PM] Lin: I can use suboptimal or I can use Trainwreck, the point remains
[12:19 PM] shin: there are two things that you can salvage by throwing more healer resources at
[12:19 PM] shin: people getting hit by mechanics they should not
[12:19 PM] shin: and people not mitigating unavoidable damage properly
[12:20 PM] shin: failing both of those things is inarguably bad play
[12:20 PM] Lin: There is a satisfaction in salvaging varying degrees of bad or mistake
[12:20 PM] shin: whether due to a mistake or laziness or whatever
[12:20 PM] Lin: Darl considers Nael phase, and the chaotic healing involved, to be the best content in the game
[12:20 PM] Lin: But if everyone does it perfectly, there’s barely any healing
[12:20 PM] Lin: Don’t even need to top people off
[12:21 PM] Lin: Aside from thermionics
[12:21 PM] shin: does he think the healing in Nael is actually interesting or the phase itself
[12:21 PM] shin: there's a distinction here
[12:21 PM] Lin: Both last I checked
[12:22 PM] Lin: Like you he likes the randomness and resulting interactions
[12:22 PM] shin: is there even extra damage you can take that doesn't kill you other than getting hit by someone's lightning
[12:23 PM] Lin: Getting killed and salvaging that is also part of nael
[12:23 PM] Lin: Unlike tea or other phases where death is wipe
[12:24 PM] Lin: Recovery from death is a skill test on the healer
[12:24 PM] Lin: I don’t particularly enjoy it, it’s a mess
[12:24 PM] Lin: But some do
[12:24 PM] Lin: And tightening buttons to the point that healers can’t exert power over a near wipe
[12:24 PM] Lin: Is not something I’d want to see outside of an ult
[12:25 PM] shin: you're free to think that
[12:25 PM] Lin: It’d remove yet another aspect from healers play, beyond the much bemoaned two button dps
[12:25 PM] shin: but that is what creates the problem that I have
[12:25 PM] shin: except it would reinforce what they actually should be doing
[12:25 PM] shin: which is coordinating mitigation and healing resources
[12:25 PM] shin: which they currently do not have to do in savage at all
[12:27 PM] Lin: TpS failed world first e8s arguably because of healer dps. Which is improved with more clever coordination. Of course that’s not mere mortal tier play
[12:28 PM] Lin: In savage, I see a tension between forcing a higher degree of coordination, and being able to salvage mishaps
[12:28 PM] Lin: You can’t have both, unless you aggressively offload healing and mit responsibility to dps
[12:29 PM] shin: most mitigation responsibility is already owned by tanks and dps
12:29 PM] Lin: Like multiple times second wind and riddle of earth
[12:29 PM] shin: healers I believe all have only 4 collective mitigations between them
[12:29 PM] Lin: Regen healers get one mit
[12:29 PM] Lin: Shield healers tend to get 2-3
[12:30 PM] Lin: Beyond shields themselves
[12:30 PM] shin: astro has 1 irrespective of sect
[12:30 PM] shin: whm has 1
[12:30 PM] shin: sch has 2
[12:30 PM] Lin: As I said.
[12:30 PM] shin: mitigation is a tank and dps responsibility
[12:31 PM] shin: granted it could be more involved
[12:31 PM] shin: (which I want it to be)
[12:31 PM] shin: but it's undeniably their job
[12:31 PM] Lin: It’s more a tank responsibility than dps
[12:31 PM] Lin: Dps get one party mit button, if that
[12:32 PM] Lin: Tanks get, again, 2-3
[12:32 PM] Lin: Like a shield healer
[12:32 PM] shin: like specifically scholar, yes
[12:33 PM] Lin: Noct ast gets collective, c-opp, and sometimes-buffed shields
[12:33 PM] shin: only one of those is mitigation
[12:33 PM] Lin: You don’t picture shields as mit, I take it
[12:33 PM] shin: shields are not mitigation
[12:34 PM] shin: shield don't reduce damage they increase hp
[12:34 PM] Lin: They extend survivability past your base hp bar
[12:34 PM] shin: there is a subtle but important difference
[12:34 PM] Lin: The subtle difference is literally the inverse of raid buff stacking
[12:34 PM] shin: the subtle difference is how they interact with multi and single hit damage instances
[12:34 PM] Lin: You still have to snapshot them in time
[12:34 PM] shin: idk what you're talking about
[12:35 PM] Lin: Ok sure, multi damage
[12:35 PM] Lin: I was referring to diminishing returns
[12:35 PM] Lin: Of stacked mit
[12:35 PM] shin: shields have diminishing returns too
[12:36 PM] Lin: I’m the one associating shields with mit here
[12:36 PM] Lin: Granted a different kind, geometrically. Not effective on multi hits, more like tactician than addle
[12:37 PM] shin: tactician and addle are the same thing
[12:37 PM] shin: (most of the time)
[12:37 PM] Lin: Those parentheses are key
[12:37 PM] shin: yeah the only difference
[12:37 PM] shin: is when damage doesn't come from the boss
[12:37 PM] shin: i.e. you can't addle
[12:37 PM] Lin: Tactician is majorly valuable in nontargetable boss mechs
[12:37 PM] shin: otherwise they're exactly the same
[12:37 PM] Lin: Which happen more and more often
[12:37 PM] Lin: And are routine in ult
[12:38 PM] Lin: Also great for when people are super spread
[12:38 PM] Lin: Or going to be
[12:38 PM] Lin: Where shields won’t reach everyone
[12:39 PM] Lin: Anyway
[12:39 PM] shin: any time you can apply tactician you can apply shields
[12:39 PM] shin: but regardless
[12:39 PM] Lin: Multi-hit, or cases where healers specifically are separated from the party
[12:40 PM] Lin: Fate calibration beta appreciates fairy and tactician and star
[12:40 PM] Lin: Remote healing and mit are real value
[12:40 PM] Lin: Or just e2s flares back in week one
[12:41 PM] shin: yeah in like less than a dozen places in the entire game
[12:41 PM] Lin: Or a8s with prey, or healer debuffs in ifrit ex and presumably uwu
[12:42 PM] Lin: Current content has it scattered a bit if you look
[12:42 PM] Lin: But it’s on the harder side of healer mechs
[12:42 PM] Lin: So they don’t overdo it
[12:42 PM] shin: what ranged healing mechanics exist in the current tier
[12:43 PM] shin: I can't think of a single time the healers are forced to be out of normal aoe healing range
[12:43 PM] shin: except far north/far south tile split
[12:43 PM] Lin: E9s tiles when people are trolling, yes
[12:43 PM] shin: which affects 1 healer at most
[12:43 PM] shin: 1 healer who can't reach 1 dps
[12:44 PM] Lin: The raidwide at end of tiles tended to delete parties that didn’t let healers in at the end
[12:44 PM] Lin: Short of spam healing gcds and praying
[12:44 PM] shin: or using mitigation
[12:45 PM] shin: :upside_down:
[12:45 PM] shin: or people just not missing heals
[12:45 PM] Lin: E10s pretty much nothing, e11s was about pre shielding and snapping small heals after cleaves, more than narnia healing
[12:46 PM] shin: since star and dawn and asylum(?) can hit everyone post stack/spread mechanic if they don't dodge it like a clown
[12:46 PM] Lin: E12 had some stack/spread memes
[12:47 PM] shin: the only time in 12 that you are out of range of aoe heals is during shiva slides if you decided you hated living and didn't come stand in the heals
[12:47 PM] Lin: But yes, most really remote healing has been in ults, and this tier had relatively few
[12:47 PM] shin: nothing special about that forces healers to be away from the party for any extended period of time
[12:48 PM] shin: actually the one other instance was week 1 vg2 strats
[12:48 PM] shin: where you actually had issues healing the caster and ranged
[12:48 PM] shin: too bad that strat died
[12:48 PM] Lin: If you’re invoking that, then downtime lions too
[12:49 PM] Lin: Geniuses making a strat with four people on the four corners of narnia
[12:49 PM] Lin: To fold the lions
[12:49 PM] shin: yeah too bad that was clearly not the intended way to do that mechanic
[12:49 PM] shin: from a healing perspective
[12:49 PM] shin: at least
[12:56 PM] Lin: if you want more coordination, taking away buttons is just tightening the noose on already suicidal salt pile healers. Pushing for more remote healing mechs and giving dps more personal mit, is a better way
[12:58 PM] shin: I never argued specifically for taking away buttons
[12:58 PM] Lin: You were indicating that L80 has an excess of buttons, to the point where coordination is unnecessary
[12:59 PM] shin: level 80 has a lack of incoming damage proportional to the number of tools we have
[12:59 PM] shin: actually
[12:59 PM] shin: an idea is
[12:59 PM] shin: remove all healing gcds
[12:59 PM] Ashelia: Is this because we out ilvled the damage that comes in, so the mit/etc isn't as relevent, or that there aren't enough instances of unavoidable damage?
[1:00 PM] shin: or rather
[1:00 PM] Lin: And again, if you take away buttons, or equivalently heavily nerf them, you are putting a noose on healers
[1:00 PM] shin: give them all longer recasts
[1:00 PM] shin: so you can't avoid planning by just spamming and overhealing
[1:00 PM] Lin: Longer recasts, aside from niche things like medica2, is just pushing the pendulum against healers ability to salvage trainwrecks
[1:01 PM] shin: unfortunately that removes the ability to do solo healing runs but u take what you can get
[1:01 PM] Lin: Not to mention freaking j-waves
[1:01 PM] shin: oh no the mechanic that happens once a tier
[1:01 PM] Lin: Solo healing runs will always be a thing so long as nonzero healer dps is a thing
[1:01 PM] Lin: Full stop
[1:01 PM] shin: solo healing runs only exist because healers have gcd heals lol
[1:01 PM] shin: if you removed them they couldn't exist
[1:02 PM] shin: even astro can't solo heal with 0 gcds
[1:02 PM] shin: they come close in some fights
[1:02 PM] shin: but you have to gcd
[1:02 PM] Lin: If you removed spammable heals, recovery from trainwreck is basically impossible
[1:02 PM] Lin: Short of having a ten stack of ED
[1:02 PM] Lin: Which is another way of saying mana management
[1:02 PM] shin: i'm almost inclined to say "fuck em"

[1:03 PM] Lin: Of course you are
[1:03 PM] shin: if you can't not trainwreck through content
[1:03 PM] shin: maybe you shouldn't be clearing
[1:03 PM] Lin: Tell that to nael
[1:03 PM] shin: well maybe we should stop dying to nael
[1:03 PM] shin: :slight_smile:
[1:03 PM] Ashelia: woah
[1:03 PM] Lin: Dude
[1:03 PM] Ashelia: that is my divine privilege and I will not have it taken away :stuck_out_tongue:
[1:03 PM] shin: LOL
[1:03 PM] Lin: Give this man a pulitzer
[1:03 PM] Lin: So brave
[1:04 PM] shin: i'm not brave
[1:04 PM] shin: can't be brave if you're not scared
[1:04 PM] shin: and what is there to be scared of
[1:04 PM] Lin: You want weird ass mechanical interactions and randomness, you gotta accept train wrecks into your cleats
[1:04 PM] shin: what???
[1:04 PM] shin: since when is that a requirement
[1:04 PM] Lin: I stand by that typo
[1:05 PM] Lin: Ok sure then let’s just have 10% of pulls be “fuck you especially”, just wipe and restart for better rng
[1:05 PM] shin: ?
[1:05 PM] shin: or
[1:05 PM] shin: simply
[1:05 PM] shin: don't fuck up
[1:05 PM] Lin: Say that to hatch “server ticks”
[1:06 PM] shin: anyone who blames a server tick is a clown
[1:06 PM] shin: this game is nothing if not consistent
[1:06 PM] shin: it's jank as shit
[1:06 PM] shin: but it is consistently jank
[1:06 PM] shin: there are no surprises
[1:06 PM] Lin: Hence air quotes
[1:06 PM] shin: so
[1:06 PM] shin: yeah
[1:06 PM] shin: if you fuck up hatches
[1:06 PM] shin: it's literally your fault
[1:07 PM] shin: there's no two ways about it
[1:07 PM] shin: how does that relate to trainwrecks being required as a product of having actually engaging mechanics
[1:08 PM] Lin: “Git gud” is at some point not a realistic demand as you scale mechanical interactions higher and higher
[1:08 PM] shin: I disagree
[1:08 PM] shin: full stop
[1:08 PM] shin: hard content should be hard
[1:08 PM] Lin: With 8 people reacting outside of a strict plan, and net code delays in seeing movement
[1:09 PM] shin: those are all known variables
[1:09 PM] Lin: Physicists call certain problems “trivial”, not because they’re easy, but because a solution exists
[1:10 PM] Lin: Knowing a ton of variables isn’t going to guarantee 100% consistency from a “good” team
[1:10 PM] Lin: And again, tea exists
[1:10 PM] Lin: For your instawipe needs
[1:10 PM] shin: if you can reach 100% consistency then the content is too easy for you idk what to tell you
[1:11 PM] Lin: So then you can either say fuck you for every mechanic in all content above extreme when shit goes a little south
[1:11 PM] Lin: Or you can accept some degree, maybe not as much as exists now but some degree, of healer healing overtuning
[1:13 PM] shin: I think your definition of a mechanic saying fuck you is different from mine
[1:13 PM] shin: "fuck you" mechanics have no solution
[1:13 PM] shin: "oh no i have to do a bunch of shit and not fuck up" is not a fuck you
[1:13 PM] Lin: I rather feel like you just need to get shoved into tea ASAP to have your mechanical strictness satisfied
[1:14 PM] Ashelia: I'll heal with you Shin. Let's go :slight_smile:
[1:14 PM] shin: :slight_smile:
[1:14 PM] Lin: Ofc people need to do a bunch of shit and at least mostly not fuck up to clear hard content
[1:14 PM] Lin: we’re not talking titan normal or titania here
[1:14 PM] shin: except they don't
[1:15 PM] Lin: They still do on e12, some say PF hasn’t cleared it since week one to this day
[1:15 PM] shin: there's people that have cleared 12 that I don't think should have cleared 12
[1:15 PM] Lin: Edge cases, dps carries who still more or less did the mechanics
[1:16 PM] shin: not edge cases
[1:16 PM] Lin: 12 near week one min ilevel is different content from bis 12
[1:16 PM] Lin: Those folks you describe didn’t clear 12 when it was “relevant”. Neither did we, technically.
[1:17 PM] shin: there's a difference between week 5 and week 20
[1:17 PM] Lin: Meh, only with respect to i530 tome weapons
[1:17 PM] shin: just like there's a difference between week 5 and week 1
[1:17 PM] shin: that's
[1:17 PM] shin: not true
[1:17 PM] shin: at all
[1:17 PM] Lin: And even then tome weaps were accessible ish
[1:18 PM] Lin: This is all a sliding scale of ilevel
[1:18 PM] Lin: Content gets deprecated over time by ilevel
[1:18 PM] Lin: Why do you think people obsess over flaunting their week one clear resumes?
[1:18 PM] shin: so, we return to my original argument of "they shouldn't have cleared 12"
[1:19 PM] Lin: Because a clear isn’t a clear, it’s a clear at x date
[1:19 PM] shin: clearing 12 at this point is meaningless
[1:19 PM] Lin: And my argument is that they didn’t clear 12, they cleared nerfed 12
[1:19 PM] shin: when I say "shouldn't have cleared" I'm talking about an ideal
[1:20 PM] Lin: Same deal with the barse runners u[timing with bis
[1:20 PM] shin: i'm talking that their level of play should not be enough to clear 12
[1:20 PM] shin: yet it was
[1:20 PM] Lin: They’re not clearing the same fight
[1:20 PM] Lin: Their level of play was enough to clear nerfed 12
[1:20 PM] Lin: And I’m saying that’s fine
[1:20 PM] shin: and I disagree
[1:20 PM] shin: because clearing nerfed 12 is meaningless
[1:21 PM] Lin: It’s meaningless, and therefore it’s fine
[1:21 PM] shin: what
[1:21 PM] shin: no
[1:21 PM] Ashelia: I'm not a fan of this interpretation. Numbers on the fight itself haven't changed. I don't think it's fair to call it nerfed.
[1:21 PM] shin: it's not fine that there's meaningless content
[1:21 PM] Lin: You can always go back to un nerfed 12
[1:21 PM] Lin: Literally today
[1:21 PM] shin: irrelevant
[1:22 PM] Lin: You’re mad at something that exists off to the side that has zero effect on you
[1:22 PM] shin: ?
[1:22 PM] Lin: Outside of polluting your PF duty completes
[1:22 PM] shin: apparently it's unreasonable to be against the "everyone can do everything" trend
[1:23 PM] Lin: I don’t get mad at handicap ramps on my way to Wendy’s
[1:23 PM] shin: that's a false equivalency
[1:23 PM] shin: these people aren't handicapped
[1:23 PM] Lin: A bit
[1:23 PM] shin: not even a bit
[1:23 PM] shin: entirely
[1:23 PM] shin: I can't believe you just equated lazy ignorance with people that can't walk
[1:23 PM] shin: lol
[1:23 PM] Lin: A majority of them would be incapable of clearing without the ramp
[1:23 PM] Lin: Not all of it is laziness
[1:23 PM] shin: I hard disagree
[1:24 PM] shin: outside of people who are -actually- handicapped
[1:24 PM] Lin: You lack perspective then, on people who didn’t suckle on the teat of gaming
[1:24 PM] shin: every person possesses the necessary capabilities to clear savage content
[1:24 PM] shin: oh, the people that didn't put in the time?
[1:24 PM] shin: those people?
[1:24 PM] shin: hmmm
[1:24 PM] Ashelia: some people ARE just incapable of pressing the buttons properly while taking in what they need to do.
[1:25 PM] Lin: “The time” being literal years of accumulated implicit reflexes and kbm/controller finesse?
[1:25 PM] shin: if you can't process input while also executing actions, then i'd expect you also to be unable to drive a car
[1:25 PM] Lin: I mean yes, given “the time” an overwhelming majority might be able to clear any content in any game ever and forever
[1:25 PM] Lin: But at some point “the time” is unreasonable and downright dickish
[1:26 PM] Lin: We can debate where the line belongs
[1:26 PM] shin: I mean, if you think that gating accomplishing things behind improvement is "dickish"
[1:26 PM] shin: then I'm ok with being a dick
[1:26 PM] Lin: But the concept of depreciating content is fine
[1:26 PM] shin: improvement is -literally- the only important thing in life at all
[1:27 PM] Lin: They still have to improve to clear nerfed 12
[1:27 PM] shin: as far as I am concerned
[1:27 PM] shin: they do not
[1:27 PM] Lin: Now you’re the one painting with a huge brush
[1:27 PM] Lin: They don’t just walk in there and clear in a pull
[1:27 PM] Lin: Objectively it takes them practice
[1:27 PM] Lin: Just as it would take them more practice to clear it pre nerf
[1:27 PM] Lin: Maybe a prohibitive amount of practice
[1:28 PM] Lin: They don’t improve to the standard of ult or pre nerfed play
[1:28 PM] Lin: And that seems to be your salt
[1:28 PM] Lin: It’s still an achievement for them, even if it’s a lesser one
[1:28 PM] Lin: You lack empathy
[1:29 PM] shin: Ah yes, the era where thinking that not everyone should be able to do everything means I lack empathy
[1:29 PM] Lin: They’re not able to do everything
[1:29 PM] Lin: You’re too laser focused on the pixels of the achievement banner
[1:29 PM] shin: for all intents and purposes as far as the game is concerned, they are
[1:30 PM] Lin: Your clear of e12 week one or week 5, is not equivalent to theirs
[1:30 PM] Lin: The game gates drops weekly
[1:30 PM] shin: as far as the game is concerned, yes it is
[1:30 PM] Lin: If you clear late, you get gear late
[1:30 PM] shin: and the penalty for that is.......?
[1:30 PM] shin: the downside is.........?
[1:32 PM] shin: B is just boring to me
[1:32 PM] Lin: This is a game, you play it. If you don't care about self-inflicted difficulty, why the !@#$ do you enjoy blu mage?
[1:33 PM] shin: blu mage isn't self inflicted?
[1:33 PM] Lin: Or solo potd?
[1:33 PM] Lin: or solo healing?
[1:33 PM] Lin: or tankcob as a concept?
[1:33 PM] shin: BECAUSE there is no difficult normally
[1:33 PM] Lin: or DRN speed runs?
[1:33 PM] shin: I'm chasing what should have always been there
[1:33 PM] shin: DRN speed runs are not HARD
[1:33 PM] shin: LMFAO
[1:33 PM] shin: what
[1:33 PM] Lin: not hard, but harder than DRN normally done
[1:33 PM] shin: no
[1:33 PM] Lin: and hence more engaging
[1:33 PM] shin: it's easier actually
[1:33 PM] Lin: it's easier in terms of time spent
[1:33 PM] shin: that
[1:33 PM] shin: is
[1:34 PM] Lin: "harder" / more engaging in terms of pressing your buttons properly
[1:34 PM] shin: the weirdest interpretation of difficulty
[1:34 PM] shin: I have ever seen
[1:34 PM] Lin: You're taking narrow and literal views of every example I give
[1:34 PM] shin: dude you vastly overestimate how hard pressing fonts and banners are
[1:34 PM] Lin: It's a minor thing, it's a meme
[1:34 PM] Lin: like tankcob is a bigger, more sophisticated meme
[1:34 PM] Lin: or blucob might have been
[1:35 PM] shin: the level of execution of tankcob is what I think it should have been for normal comps
[1:35 PM] Lin: Meme runs in this game are literally self-imposed challenges or twists
[1:35 PM] Lin: to varying degrees across a whole spectrum
[1:35 PM] shin: I'd rather the game itself just be hard
[1:35 PM] shin: relying on players to come up with ways to make the game engaging is a pity
[1:35 PM] Lin: that's just going back to you wanting infinite prefab content catering to your or peak skill level specifically
[1:36 PM] shin: or -any-
[1:36 PM] shin: content for me does not exist
[1:36 PM] Lin: which is a hopeless arms race when you get literal autists playing a specific game for a literal decade
[1:36 PM] shin: i don't care that casual content exists
[1:36 PM] shin: I do care that only casual content exists
[1:37 PM] Lin: We just got done talking about how you wanted nerfed e12 to be like week one e12. And now you're saying only casual content exists.
[1:37 PM] shin: in all games everywhere
[1:37 PM] Lin: So week one e12, week one e8, TEA, etc -- all casual
[1:37 PM] Lin: by your metric
[1:37 PM] Lin: again, a hopeless arms race
[1:37 PM] shin: week 1 e12 is exactly the same as week 20 e12 as far as the game is concerned
[1:37 PM] Lin: catering to a 0.01% fraction of a population
[1:37 PM] shin: week 1 is literally the definition of player-created difficulty
[1:37 PM] Lin: you don't have to be defined by the game's meaningless achievement banners
[1:38 PM] Lin: It's an MMO
[1:38 PM] Lin: MMOs have always been about emergent gameplay
[1:38 PM] Lin: player-created
[1:38 PM] Lin: sandbox
[1:38 PM] Lin: Even without week-1, there's always min ilevel
[1:38 PM] Lin: whether you press a min ilevel toggle, or chase down old gear
[1:38 PM] shin: and clearing min-ilevel has what practical difference?
[1:39 PM] shin: none
[1:39 PM] shin: the game literally does not care
[1:39 PM] shin: how you clear
[1:39 PM] Lin: You're refusing to recognize any form whatsoever of intrinsic motivation
[1:39 PM] shin: you get the same rewards
[1:39 PM] Lin: tankcob got a totem
[1:39 PM] shin: yeah
[1:39 PM] Lin: same as regular cob
[1:39 PM] shin: correct
[1:39 PM] shin: which is why
[1:39 PM] shin: I think
[1:39 PM] shin: regular ucob
[1:39 PM] shin: should be as hard as tankcob
[1:40 PM] shin: having the only way for it to feel like an accomplishment shouldn't be gated behind "well I simply chose to not utilize all the tools at my disposal"
[1:40 PM] shin: that's not real difficulty
[1:40 PM] Lin: tankcob isn't just saying "well, I won't use earthly star in this fight"
[1:40 PM] shin: yes it absolutely is
[1:40 PM] Lin: it's a full suite of a different kit
[1:41 PM] Lin: tankcob has aspects to it that makes ucob mechanics EASIER
[1:41 PM] Lin: not harder.
[1:41 PM] Lin: most raidwides are a joke
[1:41 PM] Lin: tankbusters are an exercise in who has an invuln off cooldown
[1:41 PM] Lin: akh morns in golden a giggle fest
[1:42 PM] shin: you're just listing the differences between tankcob and having healers
[1:42 PM] Lin: yes, differences that aren't unambiguously "I'm using less tools"
[1:42 PM] Lin: differences that are specifically, I'm using different tools
[1:42 PM] Lin: for a fresh experience
[1:43 PM] Lin: tankcob isn't 2-tanks duoing bahamut, 2/8
[1:43 PM] Lin: You wanted healers to have strictly cooldown based heals? Take a peek at the 5-summoner no-healer e4s clear
[1:44 PM] Lin: Is the game specifically structured around memes like that and tankcob to the point of rejecting other more conventional or casual playstyles?
[1:44 PM] Lin: no.
[1:44 PM] Lin: If anything I'd love it if they let blues into ucob,uwu, tea, eureka, bozja

[1:44 PM] Lin: it would totally cheapen the totems
[1:44 PM] shin: I don't think we're ever going to agree that difficulty shouldn't have to be created by arbitrary restrictions created by players
[1:44 PM] Lin: but it would be hilarious and interesting
[1:45 PM] shin: like yeah, you can make cape westwind hard
[1:45 PM] shin: and it's ok that it's not by default
[1:45 PM] shin: 100% ok
[1:45 PM] shin: it should be this way
[1:45 PM] shin: it shouldn't be hard
[1:45 PM] shin: it's level 49 content
[1:45 PM] shin: or wahtever
[1:45 PM] shin: 47?
[1:46 PM] shin: but the fact that -nothing- is inherently hard
[1:46 PM] shin: is disappointing
[1:46 PM] Lin: In those terms, I'm asserting that a good MMO sandbox should enable a spectrum of difficulty, going up yes all the way to ballbusting, but "lesser" difficulty for the 99.9% shouldn't be deleted on the altar of giving shins five more ultimates.
[1:46 PM] shin: try any ultimate
[1:46 PM] shin: so far it doesn't exist
[1:46 PM] Lin: Nothing in any game ever in the history of forever, will be hard in the sense of unreliably solvable given time and dedication.
[1:46 PM] Lin: unless it's straight-up rng unfair
[1:47 PM] Lin: they are programs
[1:47 PM] Lin: jank or not, it's deterministic and knowable
[1:47 PM] shin: yes nael is technically deterministic and knowable
[1:47 PM] shin: however
[1:47 PM] shin: still manages to be engaging
[1:47 PM] Lin: You just said ultimates aren't hard
[1:47 PM] shin: you don't have to have complex advanced AI to layer simple mechancis
[1:47 PM] shin: just layer more things
[1:48 PM] shin: broaden the timeline
[1:48 PM] Lin: Extrapolating nael to "even more nael" / mechanical layers, is not the golden road to greatness
[1:48 PM] shin: why not
[1:48 PM] shin: sounds fun as fuck
[1:48 PM] Lin: eventually it just becomes nonlinear/chaotic with certain interactions that are just fuck-you-wipe
[1:48 PM] Lin: at some point you can't just stack more mechanics
[1:48 PM] Lin: or more randomness
[1:49 PM] Lin: Can you have content like nael be consistently clearable? Yeah, nael is.
[1:49 PM] Lin: Can you have something that pushes the envelope more in nael's direction? Sure, that's conceivable. And the 13 knights of the round in the upcoming ultimate have a good shot at pulling that off.
[1:50 PM] shin: hell you could make half the fights this tier 5 times more fun by making them twice as fast and overlapping mechanics
[1:50 PM] Lin: Is there a logical limit to where N stacked random mechs become randomly unfair/unfun?
[1:50 PM] shin: most of 11 is pretty boring
[1:50 PM] shin: cycles is just
[1:50 PM] shin: 11
[1:50 PM] shin: but faster
[1:50 PM] shin: cycles is fun
[1:50 PM] shin: but I haven't seen cycles in like 8 weeks
[1:50 PM] Lin: and again we get back to the point where you lack empathy for anyone not at your skill level
[1:51 PM] shin: I don't know where you get off saying that
[1:51 PM] shin: seems like a gross mischaracterization
[1:51 PM] Lin: You want to delete/remove/make unclearable content that is currently clearable by lesser players
[1:52 PM] shin: I want hard content to exist
[1:52 PM] Lin: and you refuse to accept that some lesser players are simply, less good, and no reasonable amount of practice is going to fix that.
[1:52 PM] shin: yeah this is BS
[1:52 PM] shin: because I'm talkign specifically about
[1:52 PM] shin: current savage
[1:52 PM] Lin: Only BS insofar as your definition of reasonable
[1:52 PM] Lin: you keep saying you want hard content to exist, and turn around saying ultimates are good
[1:52 PM] Lin: so you want more ultimates?
[1:52 PM] shin: when did I say that
[1:52 PM] Lin: you like nael.
[1:53 PM] shin: I said nael is good design
[1:53 PM] shin: I didn't say ucob is hard
[1:53 PM] shin: nael is engaging
[1:53 PM] shin: p3 is somewhat engaging
[1:53 PM] shin: at points
[1:53 PM] shin: it remains to be seen what I think about the rest of it
[1:53 PM] Lin: you will be disappointed
[1:53 PM] shin: but I want harder content than this
[1:53 PM] shin: it does not exist
[1:53 PM] Lin: but tea might make you happy
[1:53 PM] Lin: insofar as you want unforgiving mechs
[1:54 PM] shin: unforgiving is not the same as unengaging
[1:54 PM] Lin: Not to derail, but you're literally playing the lowest responsibility role of an ult
[1:54 PM] shin: see we keep coming back to this
[1:54 PM] Lin: you could be getting more engagement in a different role
[1:55 PM] shin: except I didn't really get to choose my role I just filled what we didn't find
[1:55 PM] shin: I can 100% guarantee you I would have the same opinion regardless of the role I played
[1:55 PM] Lin: And I learned tanking in ucob because we lost a tank, despite not being a remotely skilled tank
[1:55 PM] Lin: did you want to tank?
[1:55 PM] shin: yes?
[1:56 PM] Lin: If you want to tank, we can shuffle roles. If you want to heal, we can shuffle roles.
[1:56 PM] Lin: I am omni.
[1:56 PM] shin: I want to play every role that's what I do
[1:56 PM] shin: it's part of the necessary pursuit of artificial challenge
[1:56 PM] Lin: I mean specifically in our ult progs
[1:56 PM] shin: since real challenge doesn't exist
[1:56 PM] shin: in this game
[1:57 PM] Lin: reality isn't real, especially in a game
[1:57 PM] shin: meaningless, continuing on
[1:57 PM] Lin: real is what you choose within the structure that exists. Just because what you want deviates a bit from the default structure doesn't invalidate the reasons why the structure is what it is
[1:58 PM] Lin: the reasons and the audience.
[1:58 PM] shin: again
[1:58 PM] shin: I am not saying casual content should not exist
[1:58 PM] shin: I'm complaining that there is nothing for players like me
[1:58 PM] shin: who actually care enough to become proficient
[1:58 PM] Lin: go knock on TpS's door or something then
[1:59 PM] Lin: do actual world prog, not the bs I plan to orchestrate
[1:59 PM] shin: yes for my 1 content every 9-12 months
[2:00 PM] Lin: you're never going to find an individual game that drowns you in your content
[2:00 PM] shin: i'm not asking to be drowned
[2:00 PM] Lin: programmers not gonna keep up
[2:00 PM] shin: that's a false dichotomy
[2:00 PM] shin: there does exist a middle ground between 1 and all
[2:00 PM] Lin: it's a hyperbole, but a lot of your displeasure with casuals comes off hyperbolically as well
[2:01 PM] shin: like what, for example
[2:01 PM] Lin: like they don't deserve to clear nerfed savage
[2:01 PM] Lin: fuck'em
[2:01 PM] Lin: i think were your words
[2:01 PM] shin: no, I said they didn't deserve to clear what I think 12 should require to clear
[2:02 PM] shin: but as far as all practical concerns go
[2:02 PM] shin: their 12 clear is equivalent
[2:02 PM] shin: to TPS's clear
[2:02 PM] Lin: It's a bit in narnia when you start asserting that people don't deserve to clear something that only exists in your head
[2:02 PM] shin: because the point was about what I think 12 should be
[2:02 PM] shin: not about what I think of the players
[2:02 PM] Lin: and get upset that they are clearing what does exist outside your head
[2:03 PM] shin: I'm upset the 12 exists as it currently does
[2:03 PM] shin: where you can clear with the level of misplay and laziness they have
[2:03 PM] shin: but I'm upset because nothing exists beyond that
[2:03 PM] shin: like
[2:03 PM] shin: sure
[2:03 PM] shin: leave savage the way it is if you want
[2:03 PM] shin: the argument just becomes
[2:04 PM] shin: "i'm upset nothing exists for me"
[2:04 PM] Lin: then express that, don't express your venom against players being bad, players clearing what they "shouldn't" clear, or that X content isn't what you want.  Focus on just saying pleasantries like wanting more ultimates.
[2:04 PM] shin: you're misinterpreting my anger as at the players
[2:04 PM] shin: I do not care about them
[2:04 PM] Lin: you insult them often enough, it comes across as that
[2:04 PM] shin: I'm disappointed in the content
[2:04 PM] shin: yeah I don't like bad players because I don't think being good requires exceptional talent
[2:05 PM] shin: that's a separate discussion
[2:05 PM] Lin: you're also denigrating everyone who finds engagement in the content, casting an aura of why should a reasonable person have fun or find a struggle or achievement in this, this is trash and easy and trivial
[2:05 PM] shin: how
[2:05 PM] Lin: by repeatedly asserting that all content in this game is easy / not hard, alongside people putting in effort to prog ucob and the other ults
[2:06 PM] Lin: Just like the barsers look down their noses at raidloggers scuffing reclears
[2:06 PM] shin: bad analogy because raidloggers wouldn't scuff reclears if they didn't raidlog
[2:07 PM] Lin: wow, a tautology
[2:07 PM] shin: they simply choose to not engage with the game for a week then stumble through reclears
[2:07 PM] shin: of course it's going to be scuffed
[2:07 PM] shin: but they inflict that upon themselves
[2:07 PM] shin: it's not based on their abilities
[2:07 PM] shin: it's based on their choices
[2:07 PM] Lin: yes, they do. But they don't deserve to be scorned for it
[2:07 PM] shin: no one is scorning them
[2:07 PM] Lin: the barsers can choose to avoid reclearing with those folks
[2:07 PM] Lin: plenty of barsers did and do actively scorn them, us.
[2:08 PM] Lin: exhibit andrew
[2:08 PM] Lin: or that guy who insisted you were fucking up door boss
[2:08 PM] Lin: something about tanks with egos in this game, i swear
[2:09 PM] shin: cellar had nothing to do with the raidlogging vs not distinction
[2:09 PM] shin: that was an argument purely centered around poor social skills
[2:09 PM] Lin: he comes from the not-raidlogging community, and brought those standards into raidlogging
[2:09 PM] Lin: and yes, had terrible social skills
[2:10 PM] Lin: that andrew guy had classically good social skills like any psychopath, and used it to try to neg us
[2:10 PM] shin: 99% of the people I've met don't have any issue with people that raidlog and they simply choose to not engage
[2:10 PM] Lin: mhm, and that's cool
[2:10 PM] shin: there's always people on both sides that have issues
[2:11 PM] shin: for god knows what reason
[2:11 PM] Lin: naturally
[2:11 PM] Lin: toxic casuals also exist
[2:11 PM] Lin: in abundance
[2:11 PM] shin: so it's not "just like barsers look down their noses at raidloggers"
[2:14 PM] Lin: Circling back, the analogy i'm drawing is the complaints that, yes, a subset, of barsers vocally repeat about raidloggers, compared to your complaints about no content/ultimate/anything in this game being hard, in front of a group that's actively working on said content.  You can back up and say not-hard isn't the same as effortless, but it harshes the vibe, man
[2:15 PM] Lin: i favor stoicism
[2:15 PM] Lin: find satisfaction in what is
[2:15 PM] Lin: even if it means player-created challenges
[2:15 PM] Lin: and ofc feel free to push suggestions to the developers
[2:16 PM] shin: -no one- is going to make content for players like me because there is no financial incentive
[2:16 PM] Lin: that's a truth
[2:16 PM] Lin: whether or not there might be content out there that scratches, or could scratch, your itches to some degree with the right perspective, that's a truth.
[2:17 PM] shin: Like I'm sorry if me saying that this game isn't hard is hurting people's feelings, but in the same stretch, invalidating my desires is also unsavory
[2:17 PM] shin: If people came and told me that x thing I'm attempting to learn isn't that hard, I've never once gotten upset by this
[2:17 PM] shin: if anything it's encouraging
[2:17 PM] shin: so maybe I'm just different from everyone else idfk
[2:18 PM] tanyao1000: you know when they delay dsw ultimate so many casuals screaming "you 1% dont deserve a content"
[2:18 PM] tanyao1000: :sadcat:
[2:18 PM] shin: also true
[2:18 PM] Lin: of course, coming from your perspective of wanting something ever-harder, you're not gonna get upset by being told something's not so bad.
[2:18 PM] shin: I can flip that by saying "if you're okay with how hard something is, someone saying they don't think it's that hard shouldn't invalidate you"
[2:18 PM] shin: something something intrinsic motivation
[2:19 PM] shin: or something
[2:19 PM] Lin: I was aiming more along the lines of a challenge focused mindset
[2:19 PM] Lin: "not so bad/hard" in the sense of, this is achievable
[2:19 PM] shin: as opposed to what
[2:19 PM] Lin: like a pep rally for sports
[2:19 PM] shin: a mindset where everything should be handed to you?
[2:20 PM] Lin: ofc not, and it's an exaggeration to say lesser players don't struggle in their own way in stuff that you would consider handed to you in their place
[2:20 PM] shin: I've never said people don't struggle with some things I find easy now
[2:20 PM] Lin: But if you could just express things as "I want harder", instead of "wow nothing is hard am disappoint"
[2:21 PM] tanyao1000: it's also the mindset of receiver.
you can interpret 'it's not hard' as "oh so if put some effort to read and learn i can do it too" or "and you implying i'm dumb"
[2:21 PM] shin: ^
[2:21 PM] shin: what tanyao said
[2:21 PM] tanyao1000: and also, shin is more talented at playing this than average
[2:21 PM] shin: former is what everyone should be striving to adopt, latter is a weak mindset that I'm not going to cater to
[2:21 PM] tanyao1000: the gold 100 club
[2:21 PM] shin: I'm not even talented I just fucking play the game
[2:21 PM] shin: I hate people calling it talent
[2:21 PM] shin: I play the game and use my brain
[2:21 PM] Lin: it wouldn't come off so harshly.  I've spent my time in this game mostly bootstrapping up against walls of at best benevolent negligence, trying to execute the challenges it has to offer
[2:22 PM] tanyao1000: you know not everyone's brain is as fast :sadcat: .
[2:22 PM] shin: this game doesn't need 200 iq to be good at, you just have to open your eyes, open your mind, and talk to people
[2:22 PM] shin: that's what I did
[2:22 PM] tanyao1000: like i'm probably never get a pink
[2:22 PM] shin: you can 100% get a pink if you wanted to
[2:23 PM] tanyao1000: or i'd say with the effort i want to put in this game
[2:23 PM] shin: like are you going to be single digit ranks maybe not necessarily without a fuck ton of work and some really annoying spreadsheeting on astro

reply to: [2:21 PM] tanyao1000: it's also the mindset of receiver.
you can interpret 'it's not hard' as "oh so if put some effort to read and learn i can do it too" or "and you implying i'm dumb"
[2:23 PM] Lin: The distinction in the vibe here is, "put some effort to read and learn" is sounding very much equated to "shin-level play should be trivial"

[2:23 PM] shin: shin level play is literally just thinking about what you're doing, talking to people that know more than you, and using what they teach you
[2:24 PM] shin: that's not a high bar
[2:24 PM] Lin: it's a matter of degree
[2:24 PM] Lin: especially the using part
[2:24 PM] tanyao1000: thinking is hard you know lmao
[2:24 PM] Lin: unironically
[2:25 PM] tanyao1000: people cant even answer a question in the interview
[2:25 PM] tanyao1000: from my first hand experience
[2:25 PM] Lin: and that's what i mean by empathy. Not like you're showing none at all, but could stand to show more
[2:25 PM] shin: maybe if people didn't choose to live life with their brains turned off 99% of the time
[2:25 PM] shin: then they'd find thinking easier
[2:25 PM] tanyao1000: why is it so hard to return a count(*) instead of selecting every column
[2:25 PM] shin: yeah it requires effort
[2:25 PM] shin: amazing
[2:25 PM] Lin: and you'd be less stressed out with a bit of stoicism besides
[2:26 PM] shin: sounds a lot like simply not caring
[2:26 PM] shin: which is a poor solution
[2:26 PM] Lin: it's the concept of a sphere of control
[2:26 PM] Ashelia: because that's not the solution I found of Stack Overflow
[2:26 PM] shin: also I'm not stressed out I don't know why you think having opinions is equivalent to being stressed
[2:26 PM] shin: I don't lose sleep over there being no hard content
[2:26 PM] Lin: not solving climate change solo isn't not caring
[2:26 PM] shin: or games
[2:26 PM] tanyao1000: today i even added "e.g. your sql query should return 1"
[2:26 PM] tanyao1000: and it's not helping
[2:26 PM] tanyao1000: and that's the best candidate we get so far
[2:27 PM] shin: this is more a question of degree that it is binary
[2:27 PM] shin: people don't try to solve climate change because at the core they don't really care
[2:27 PM] shin: but that's going to get into a different philosophical debate
[2:27 PM] Lin: people collectively don't, or the people with leverage don't
[2:27 PM] shin: but tl;dr you show what you actually care about by what you do, not by what you say
[2:27 PM] shin: any individual
[2:28 PM] shin: saying you care about something is really easy
[2:28 PM] shin: actually caring is a lot harder
[2:28 PM] Lin: all i'm saying is there's a limit to what you can control, to the point that it's not worth the stress of complaining so harshly on certain things. Not that criticism in general is invalid
[2:28 PM] shin: there is no stress in complaining lol
[2:28 PM] shin: at least for me
[2:28 PM] shin: like I said
[2:28 PM] shin: saying words is easy
[2:29 PM] Lin: like in this whole mess of text and other chats I've agreed that more remote healing, more involved mechs would be neat. Medica 2 on a cooldown would be neat. And so on.
[2:29 PM] Lin: There is room for more complexity in this game, for sure
[2:30 PM] Lin: certain approaches toward it, like tightening the noose on healers by nerfing their hps directly, are both unlikely (philosophically in opposition to the devs) and would have consequences in breaking aspects/levels of play that you specifically don't care for.
[2:31 PM] shin: I don't think I've ever asked for the removal of anything except gear
[2:31 PM] shin: cus gear in its current iteration I think is just boring and doesn't meaningfully add to the game
[2:31 PM] Lin: I too would be thrilled if core rankings were restricted to minimal-gear states
[2:32 PM] Ashelia: I'm reminded of when we were looking for a new Internal IT person. We setup a test machine that had DNS messed up. "simple fix" to just flush dns.... nobody we interviewed figured it out... idk people are weird in interviews.
[2:32 PM] shin: not min gear
[2:32 PM] shin: no gear
[2:32 PM] shin: fuck gear
[2:32 PM] shin: but regardless
[2:32 PM] Lin: Gear in its current iteration is somewhat boring, and what (little, perhaps) it does add is meaningful but not to you
[2:32 PM] shin: so
[2:32 PM] shin: no
[2:32 PM] shin: I disagree
[2:32 PM] shin: straight number increases are not meaningful
[2:32 PM] Lin: They directly cause qualitative changes in people's strats
[2:33 PM] Lin: and qualitative changes in the fuckery permissible
[2:33 PM] Lin: both sophisticated u[time or just bad play
[2:33 PM] shin: I don't really care for either, as we've covered
[2:33 PM] Lin: so they're not meaningful to you, and that's fine
[2:32 PM] shin: so
[2:32 PM] shin: no
[2:32 PM] shin: I disagree
[2:32 PM] shin: straight number increases are not meaningful
[2:32 PM] Lin: They directly cause qualitative changes in people's strats
[2:33 PM] Lin: and qualitative changes in the fuckery permissible
[2:33 PM] Lin: both sophisticated u[time or just bad play
[2:33 PM] shin: I don't really care for either, as we've covered
[2:33 PM] Lin: so they're not meaningful to you, and that's fine
[2:33 PM] Lin: but they're meaningful in other ways
[2:34 PM] shin: like yeah uptime strats are novel
[2:34 PM] shin: but that doesnt' solve the problem where
[2:34 PM] Lin: They're also a clean solution to having a relatively easily balanced game/meta
[2:34 PM] Lin: despite being a bit  boring
[2:34 PM] shin: it doesn't feel like there's content where it's a feat to actually clear
[2:34 PM] Lin: content where it's a feat for you to clear
[2:34 PM] shin: obviously
[2:35 PM] Lin: not obviously
[2:35 PM] Lin: use the words
[2:35 PM] shin: "it doesn't feel like there's"
[2:35 PM] shin: this is my feeling
[2:35 PM] shin: I said it
[2:35 PM] shin: it's not possible to speak about other people's feelings
[2:35 PM] Lin: you is the object, without you the implicit object is it doesn't feel like there's content where it's a feat for [people] to actually clear
[2:35 PM] shin: I'm sure there are people that feel it is a feat to clear extreme primals
[2:36 PM] shin: and that's a good thing
[2:36 PM] Lin: yup
[2:36 PM] Lin: and they're not wrong, it is a feat for them, to them, to clear
[2:36 PM] shin: which is why it's a good thing
[2:36 PM] Lin: it's just not a feat for you
[2:36 PM] shin: and eventually they'll improve past that
[2:36 PM] Lin: hopefully
[2:36 PM] shin: and it will no longer be hard
[2:37 PM] Lin: and eventually maybe they'll improve past e12
[2:37 PM] shin: to what
[2:37 PM] Lin: and join the ranks of ult memers
[2:37 PM] shin: yeah
[2:37 PM] shin: and then
[2:37 PM] Lin: tankcobbers
[2:37 PM] shin: to what
[2:37 PM] shin: yeah welcome to the land of artificial difficulty
[2:37 PM] Lin: if we spent more time celebrating memes, yes, artificial difficulty
[2:37 PM] Lin: maybe people would feel more welcomed and encouraged to engage with difficult content for its own sake
[2:38 PM] Lin: maybe you'd actually have serious blind prog groups, vs. watch-mrhappy-get-banana
[2:38 PM] shin: no one will ever just do content for the sake of doing it outside of the small portion of us that actually enjoy it
[2:38 PM] Lin: vs. the elite walling themselves off in their optimization towers and complaining about no content
[2:38 PM] shin: this is very evident
[2:38 PM] shin: in all walks of life
[2:38 PM] Lin: life is as much about finding your people as anything else
[2:39 PM] Lin: big world, yada yada
[2:39 PM] shin: so, no, content for the sake of content is never going to be a wide scale thing, realistically
[2:40 PM] shin: no one operates that way
[2:40 PM] Lin: wao i feel so invalidated
[2:40 PM] shin: you don't even disagree
[2:40 PM] Lin: regretfully
[2:40 PM] shin: when there's no practical reason to do something
[2:40 PM] Lin: but i take satisfaction in what i can, where i can
[2:40 PM] shin: people won't do it
[2:40 PM] shin: people don't even do things when there is a practical reason to do it
[2:40 PM] shin: see: most adults

[2:41 PM] Lin: and i be a rallying point to encourage others to tiptoe out of that line sometimes
[2:41 PM] shin: but as a culture we're becoming more and more allergic to the idea of difficulty
[2:41 PM] Lin: sometimes you gotta be the change you want to see in the world
[2:41 PM] shin: and more married to the dogma of accessibility
[2:41 PM] Lin: thanks obama
[2:42 PM] shin: and no one is going to stop and consider if it's a good thing
[2:42 PM] shin: until we're living wall-e
[2:42 PM] shin: and we have to be saved by a dumbfuck robot box
[2:42 PM] shin: and a sperm cell
[2:42 PM] shin: or whatever the fuck they were
[2:42 PM] Lin: Complaining about devs giving accessibility is like demanding the devs be the dumbfuck robot box that saves us
[2:43 PM] Lin: kinda
[2:43 PM] shin: I'm not faulting the dev for doing the financially responsible thing
[2:43 PM] shin: they are, for these intents and purposes, doing the "correct" thing
[2:43 PM] shin: I'll never generate as much revenue as people that buy 10 fantasias every day to RP in limsa
[2:44 PM] Lin: so acknowledge the limits of what exist, petition them to offer accessibility options for hardcore people like enabling more memes or difficulty modes (though not much difference between a mode and a self-imposed difficulty, if you're intrinsically motivated)
[2:44 PM] Lin: just don't expect any movement if your petitions also involve breaking the accessibility part
[2:44 PM] shin: I don't want a box to tick that makes something harder
[2:45 PM] shin: or easier
[2:45 PM] shin: I want it to just exist
[2:45 PM] shin: and you either do it or you don't
[2:45 PM] shin: if it's too hard you just don't do it
[2:45 PM] shin: and that's ok
[2:45 PM] shin: but apparently
[2:45 PM] shin: we decided it's not ok
[2:45 PM] Lin: TEA is literally that. Savage is that, for a lot of people.
[2:45 PM] shin: current savage I would argue that anyone could do
[2:45 PM] Lin: nobody is designing ults to make them accessible to lesser players
[2:46 PM] Lin: not a single person in SE dev is thinking that way
[2:46 PM] shin: I do acknowledge that ults do have a barrier and some people will just not be able to do them
[2:46 PM] shin: that's a good thing
[2:46 PM] shin: but that doesn't stop me from being disappointed and wanting an even higher obstacle to learn to climb
[2:46 PM] Lin: in fact they're barring blucob and bluwu specifically because they don't want the tickbox
[2:46 PM] Lin: as much as i find that irritating
[2:46 PM] shin: and this expands into every other game I've played
[2:47 PM] Lin: ever play battletoads?
[2:47 PM] shin: the only place I've found meaningful scaling difficulty is in pvp games
[2:47 PM] Lin: you should play battletoads.
[2:47 PM] shin: isn't that on a console I don't own
[2:47 PM] shin: otherwise I would have
[2:47 PM] Lin: just emulate
[2:47 PM] Lin: it's like NES
[2:47 PM] Lin: probably an internet ripoff of it out there
[2:47 PM] Lin: browser-based or whatever
[2:48 PM] shin: oh I don't emulate
[2:48 PM] Lin: your bar for meaningful is higher than you think it is, and especially hard for PvE to implement because it's not inherently scalable like pvp -- devs can only code so many mechanics, and it's all deterministic in the end
[2:49 PM] Lin: battletoads is like 1990s or 1980s
[2:49 PM] shin: nael is also deterministic
[2:49 PM] shin: -technically-
[2:49 PM] Lin: yup
[2:49 PM] Lin: so is ninja gaiden or dark souls or whatever
[2:49 PM] shin: human brain just can't do it realistically
[2:49 PM] shin: which means it's engaging
[2:49 PM] shin: but it's pretty trivial for a computer to do
[2:49 PM] Lin: ehh
[2:50 PM] Lin: i've yet to see sales groups selling 8-bot ucob clears
[2:50 PM] shin: it's not hard to code 5 sets of mechs to target 8 people in a random order
[2:50 PM] shin: no I meant the creation part
[2:50 PM] Lin: oh
[2:50 PM] Lin: it is hard to code them in such a way that their interactions are still mostly fair
[2:50 PM] Lin: WoW devs routinely fuck it up
[2:50 PM] Lin: their raids are all about random mech assignments
[2:50 PM] shin: it's hard to think of them in a way that's fair
[2:51 PM] shin: but implementing it
[2:51 PM] shin: not hard
[2:51 PM] Lin: implementing known code is literal monkey copypaste
[2:51 PM] shin: dragons in nael can target anyone at any time
[2:51 PM] Lin: i'm talking about playtesting
[2:51 PM] Lin: balance testing
[2:51 PM] shin: not a lot of caveats to keep it "fair" implemented
[2:51 PM] shin: ya well this is why making a game is hard
[2:51 PM] shin: and not everyone can do it
[2:52 PM] shin: :smile:
[2:52 PM] Lin: so balance out the sadge with a bit of appreciation for what they have accomplished
[2:52 PM] Lin: 'cause it's hard
[2:53 PM] shin: I don't discount their accomplishments for dealing with a disaster of a codebase built in 2011 based on archaic design philosophies
[2:53 PM] shin: but that doesn't change that neither they nor anyone else has produced content for me
[2:53 PM] Lin: they did actually rewrite ARR from mostly scratch, i'm told. The archaic part isn't 1.0, it's 2.0
[2:53 PM] Lin: in retrospect, vs. today
[2:53 PM] Lin: also that it was crunch time work
[2:54 PM] shin: old vs way old
[2:54 PM] shin: it needs to be rewritten again
[2:54 PM] shin: is the bottom line
[2:54 PM] Lin: and it will be, some day
[2:54 PM] Lin: FFXIV won't be infinite
[2:54 PM] shin: but MMOs are stupid amount of investment
[2:54 PM] shin: it's actually
[2:54 PM] shin: a terrible genre
[2:54 PM] shin: all things considered
[2:54 PM] shin: like practically speaking
[2:54 PM] Lin: it's high risk high reward
[2:54 PM] Lin: unless you target whales in korea
[2:54 PM] Lin: then it's just high reward

etc conversation meanders to unimportant things after this
